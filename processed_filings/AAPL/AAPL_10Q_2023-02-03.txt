Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

[TABLE_START]
Three Months Ended | December 31, | 2022 | December 25, | 2021 | Numerator: | Net income | $ | 29,998 | $ | 34,630 | Denominator: | Weighted-average basic shares outstanding | 15,892,723 | 16,391,724 | Effect of dilutive securities | 62,995 | 127,567 | Weighted-average diluted shares | 15,955,718 | 16,519,291 | Basic earnings per share | $ | 1.89 | $ | 2.11 | Diluted earnings per share | $ | 1.88 | $ | 2.10
[TABLE_END]

Approximately 89 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.6 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects 63 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 11 % and 10 %, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 16 %. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %.

Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Available Information

The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

Fiscal Period

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.

Quarterly Highlights

Total net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.

During the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro ® powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.

The Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.

COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the Company’s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity, impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments.

Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Segment Operating Performance

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”

The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):

Americas

Americas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad.

Europe

Europe net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.

[TABLE_END]

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.

Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form 10-K.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II  —  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings

Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.

Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.
