NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Significant Accounting Policies

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2022 is a 52-week year and fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. The first quarters of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were both 13-week quarters.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Note 2 - Business Combination

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40 billion. We paid $ 2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock, which had an aggregate value of $ 21.5 billion as of the date of the Purchase Agreement. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $ 5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $ 1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2 billion

paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $ 0.17 billion and royalties of $ 0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $ 1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The Signing Consideration was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information

Note 5 – Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

[TABLE_END]

(1)    Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.

(2)    Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.

Note 6 – Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $ 132 million and $ 64 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 6.5 % and 6.6 % for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The slight decrease in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a change in the jurisdiction of earnings, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit.

Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

As of May 2, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.3 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of May 2, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Note 8 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.

[TABLE_START]
Fair Value at | Pricing Category | May 2, 2021 | January 31, 2021 | (In millions) | Assets | Cash equivalents and marketable securities: | Money market funds | Level 1 | $ | 319 | $ | 313 | Corporate debt securities | Level 2 | $ | 5,242 | $ | 4,444 | Debt securities issued by United States government agencies | Level 2 | $ | 3,046 | $ | 2,976 | Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury | Level 2 | $ | 2,821 | $ | 2,846 | Certificates of deposit | Level 2 | $ | 884 | $ | 705 | Foreign government bonds | Level 2 | $ | 67 | $ | 67 | Prepaid expenses and other current assets: | Publicly-held equity security (1) | Level 1 | $ | 133 | $ | — | Other assets: | Investment in non-affiliated entities (2) | Level 3 | $ | 146 | $ | 144 | Liabilities | 2.20 | % Notes Due 2021 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 1,006 | $ | 1,011 | 3.20 | % Notes Due 2026 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 1,101 | $ | 1,124 | 2.85 | % Notes Due 2030 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 1,592 | $ | 1,654 | 3.50 | % Notes Due 2040 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 1,095 | $ | 1,152 | 3.50 | % Notes Due 2050 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 2,158 | $ | 2,308 | 3.70 | % Notes Due 2060 (3) | Level 2 | $ | 552 | $ | 602

(1)    The balance as of May 2, 2021 includes an investment that was reclassified from privately-held equity securities following the commencement of public market trading of the issuer in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As of May 2, 2021, the investment is subject to short-term selling restrictions. Due to the public market trading of the issuer, an unrealized gain on the investment of $ 124 million was recorded in other income (expense), net in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The net cumulative unrealized gain on the investment was $ 130 million as of May 2, 2021.

(2)    Investment in private non-affiliated entities is recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. The amount recorded as of May 2, 2021 has not been significant.

(3)    These liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and are not marked to fair value each period.

[TABLE_END]

(1)    As of May 2, 2021, acquisition-related intangible assets include the fair value of a Mellanox in-process research and development, or IPR&D, project of $ 630 million, which has not yet commenced amortization. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $ 137 million and $ 7 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets, excluding IPR&D, as of May 2, 2021 is estimated to be $ 412 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2022, $ 546 million in fiscal year 2023, $ 424 million in fiscal year 2024, $ 370 million in fiscal year 2025, $ 99 million in fiscal year 2026, and $ 132 million in fiscal year 2027 and thereafter.

Deferred Revenue

The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021:

[TABLE_START]
May 2, | April 26, | 2021 | 2020 | (In millions) | Balance at beginning of period | $ | 451 | $ | 201 | Deferred revenue added during the period | 178 | 110 | Revenue recognized during the period | ( | 123 | ) | ( | 70 | ) | Balance at end of period | $ | 506 | $ | 241
[TABLE_END]

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the remaining contracted license, development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of May 2, 2021, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 680 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 48 % as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of May 2, 2021 and January 31, 2021.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of May 2, 2021 and January 31, 2021:

[TABLE_START]
May 2, | 2021 | January 31, | 2021 | (In millions) | Designated as cash flow hedges | $ | 888 | $ | 840 | Not designated for hedge accounting | $ | 402 | $ | 441
[TABLE_END]

As of May 2, 2021, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next 12 months was not significant.

During the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 30 million and $ 22 million as of May 2, 2021 and January 31, 2021, respectively, and the activities related to the warranty liabilities were not significant.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Litigation

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of May 2, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through May 2, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of May 2, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022.

Note 15 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our two operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking." Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI, high performance computing, or HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; cryptocurrency mining processors, or CMP; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.

Our two operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking," as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid the Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common

[PAGE BREAK]

stock, which had an aggregate value of $21.5 billion as of the date of the Purchase Agreement. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The Signing Consideration was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Demand

Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we believe Gaming benefited from cryptocurrency mining demand, although it is hard to determine to what extent. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and notebook workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.

Supply

Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. To have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. We expect to remain supply-constrained into the second half of the fiscal year, primarily in gaming. We may need to place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply.

COVID-19

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Some regions are easing COVID-19 related restrictions; however, most of our employees continue to work remotely and we continue to temporarily prohibit most business travel.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and affect our business and financial results. Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, notebook workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home trends and desktop workstations have started to recover as employees return onsite in certain markets. As our own offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors.”

We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations.

First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 Summary

[TABLE_START]
Three Months Ended | May 2, 2021 | January 31, 2021 | April 26, 2020 | Quarter-over-Quarter Change | Year-over-Year Change | ($ in millions, except per share data) | Revenue | $ | 5,661 | $ | 5,003 | $ | 3,080 | 13 | % | 84 | % | Gross margin | 64.1 | % | 63.1 | % | 65.1 | % | 100 bps | (100) bps | Operating expenses | $ | 1,673 | $ | 1,650 | $ | 1,028 | 1 | % | 63 | % | Income from operations | $ | 1,956 | $ | 1,507 | $ | 976 | 30 | % | 100 | % | Net income | $ | 1,912 | $ | 1,457 | $ | 917 | 31 | % | 109 | % | Net income per diluted share | $ | 3.03 | $ | 2.31 | $ | 1.47 | 31 | % | 106 | %
[TABLE_END]

We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.

Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $5.66 billion, up 84% from a year earlier. Revenue was up 13% sequentially with growth in all market platforms.

Gaming revenue was up 106% from a year ago and up 11% sequentially, reflecting higher sales in GeForce GPUs, as well as in game-console SOCs. We continued to benefit from strong sales of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. We believe Gaming also benefited from cryptocurrency mining demand, although it is hard to determine to what extent.

Data Center revenue was up 79% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-on-year revenue growth was driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture products into vertical industries and hyperscale customers. Sequentially, growth in Data Center came from both compute and networking products, primarily driven by hyperscale customers.

Professional Visualization revenue was up 21% from both a year earlier and sequentially. The year-on-year increase was driven by sales of notebook workstation GPUs. The sequential growth reflects sales of GPUs for both desktop and notebook workstations.

Automotive revenue was down 1% from a year earlier and up 6% sequentially.

OEM and Other revenue was up 137% from a year ago and up 114% sequentially, primarily reflecting the addition of CMP, which generated revenue of $155 million.

Gross margin was down 100 basis points from a year earlier due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Mellanox acquisition and a shift in the mix of Data Center products, partially offset by a lower contribution from Automotive products. Gross margin was up 100 basis points sequentially due to a more favorable mix within Data Center and the addition of CMP products.

Operating expenses were up 63% from a year earlier, which did not include Mellanox, and up 1% sequentially. In addition to Mellanox, the year-on-year increase was primarily driven by compensation-related costs, including employee growth and infrastructure costs. Sequential costs were relatively flat, with increased expenses from growth in employees offset by the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Income from operations was $1.96 billion, up 100% from a year earlier and up 30% sequentially. Net income was $1.91 billion. Net income per diluted share was $3.03, up 106% from a year earlier and up 31% sequentially.

25

[PAGE BREAK]

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the first quarter were $12.67 billion, down from $16.35 billion a year earlier and up from $11.56 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects payment for Mellanox acquisition, while the sequential increase primarily reflects growth in operating income.

We paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends in the first quarter.

On May 21, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a four-for-one split of our common stock payable in the form of a stock dividend, with the additional shares expected to be distributed on July 19, 2021. The stock dividend is conditioned on obtaining stockholder approval at our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 3, 2021 to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2 billion to 4 billion.

Market Platform Highlights

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, in our Gaming platform, we launched GeForce RTX 3060 laptop GPU systems; announced GeForce 3050 Ti and 3050 laptop GPUs; accelerated RTX momentum with now over 60 games; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; announced that NVIDIA Reflex is incorporated in more games; and announced that GeForce NOW has over 10 million members.

[TABLE_END]

Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased 81% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs which benefited from continued strong sales of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. Additionally, revenue increased from higher sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations and game console SOCs. We believe this segment also benefited from cryptocurrency mining demand, although it is hard to determine to what extent.

Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased 88% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, reflecting the addition of Mellanox, which we acquired on April 27, 2020.  Revenue also increased due to the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture products into vertical industries and hyperscale customers and the addition of CMP revenue.

Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 86% and 84% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

27

[PAGE BREAK]

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 or 2021.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin decreased to 64.1% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 from 65.1% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to the Mellanox acquisition and a shift in the mix of Data Center products, partially offset by a lower contribution from Automotive products.

Inventory provisions totaled $58 million and $36 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $21 million and $39 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.6% and a favorable impact of 0.1% in the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, primarily due to reduced contribution from lower margin products.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a shift in the mix of Data Center products, partially offset by a lower contribution from Automotive solutions.

Operating Expenses

[TABLE_END]

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by 57% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. The increase also reflects the impact of employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. The increase also reflects the impact of employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, and costs related to the pending acquisition of Arm.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $6 million and $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $53 million and $25 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, mark to market adjustment of our publicly-traded equity security investment and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $135 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and not significant during the first quarter

28

[PAGE BREAK]

of fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $124 million unrealized gain from an equity investment in a company that commenced public trading. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $132 million and $64 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 6.5% and 6.6% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The slight decrease in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a change in the jurisdiction of earnings, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit.

Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

[TABLE_END]

As of May 2, 2021, we had $12.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $1.11 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in outstanding trade receivables due to higher revenue and corresponding shipment linearity.

Cash used in investing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to cash used in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects higher purchases of marketable securities, and higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, offset by higher sales and maturities of marketable securities.

Cash used in financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and higher payments related to tax on restricted stock units.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of May 2, 2021, we had $12.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of May 2, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.

Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities

We have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.

We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal proceedings since January 31, 2021. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and affect our business and financial results and it has increased the duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, notebook workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home trends and desktop workstations have started to recover as employees return onsite in certain markets.

In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. The reopening of offices may also generate demand for our products that may be temporary. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters is in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Some regions are easing COVID-19 related restrictions; however, most of our employees continue to work remotely and we continue to temporarily prohibit most business travel. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:

• our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;

• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;

• fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021;

• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;

• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;

• our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;

• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;

• our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;

• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;

• inventory write-downs;

• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;

• our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;

• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;

• customer bad debt write-offs;

• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;

• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;

• our ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls;

• increases in our future tax rates, as discussed further in the risk factor “We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021;

• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and

• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets, including global and domestic inflation rates.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through May 2, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of May 2, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
