NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2020 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report include the financial results of Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, prospectively from April 27, 2020. For additional details, refer to Note 2 - Business Combination.

Significant Accounting Policies

Except for the accounting policies for business combination and investment in non-affiliated entities, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, or IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our condensed consolidated statements of income.

We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. We assess for impairment thereafter. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities

Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year and fiscal year 2020 is a 52-week year. The second quarters of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were both 13-week quarters.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 - Business Combination

On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

The aggregate purchase consideration has been preliminarily allocated as follows (in millions):

[TABLE_START]
Purchase Price | Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) | $ | 7,033 | Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) | 16 | Total cash consideration | 7,049 | Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) | 85 | Total purchase consideration | $ | 7,134 | Allocation | Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 115 | Marketable securities | 699 | Accounts receivable, net | 216 | Inventories | 320 | Prepaid expenses and other assets | 179 | Property and equipment, net | 144 | Goodwill | 3,431 | Intangible assets | 2,970 | Accounts payable | ( | 136 | ) | Accrued and other current liabilities | ( | 236 | ) | Income tax liability | ( | 191 | ) | Deferred income tax liability | ( | 258 | ) | Other long-term liabilities | ( | 119 | ) | $ | 7,134
[TABLE_END]

(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.

(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.

(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.

We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their estimated fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of the acquisition and are subject to change during the measurement period which is not expected to exceed one year. The primary tasks that are required to be completed include validation of business level forecasts, jurisdictional forecasts, customer attrition rates, contingent liabilities assessments and any related tax impacts from the acquisition. Any adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period will be recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 15 – Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 from the acquisition date. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 14 % of consolidated revenue. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration.

Acquisition-related costs of $ 26 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for the first half of fiscal year 2021.

Intangible Assets

The estimated fair value and weighted average useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:

[TABLE_START]
Fair Value | Weighted Average Useful Lives | (In millions) | Developed technology (1) | $ | 1,640 | 5 | years | Customer relationships (2) | 440 | 3 | years | Order backlog (3) | 190 | Based on actual shipments | Trade names (4) | 70 | 5 | years | Total identified finite-lived intangible assets | 2,340 | IPR&D (5) | 630 | N/A | Total identified intangible assets | $ | 2,970
[TABLE_END]

(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.

(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach.

(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.

Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 630 million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project will be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 or of the results of our future operations of the combined businesses.

The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $ 161 million in the first half of fiscal year 2020 and were excluded from the pro forma results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments.

Note 3 - Leases

Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of July 26, 2020, are as follows:

Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.

Note 6 – Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax benefit of $ 13 million and an income tax expense of $ 52 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and an income tax expense of $ 54 million and $ 48 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 2.0 % for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 3.3 % for the first half of fiscal year 2021, and 8.8 % and 4.9 % for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.

Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $ 256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $ 153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. Upon finalization of the purchase price allocation, additional adjustments to the amount of our net deferred taxes and long-term tax liabilities may be required.

As of July 26, 2020, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 675 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

For the first half of fiscal year 2021, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we assumed $ 59 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $ 4 million of related interest through the Mellanox acquisition. Other than these amounts, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities.  As of July 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the remaining contracted license, development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of July 26, 2020, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 670 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 40 % as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of July 26, 2020 and January 26, 2020.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including intercompany hedging instruments, or intercompany derivatives, with wholly-owned subsidiaries in order to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of July 26, 2020 and January 26, 2020:

[TABLE_START]

[TABLE_END]

As of July 26, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months . The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Note 12 - Debt

Long-Term Debt

In March 2020, we issued $ 1.50 billion of the 2.85 % Notes Due 2030, $ 1.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2040, $ 2.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2050, and $ 500 million of the 3.70 % Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. Interest on the March 2020 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2020. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2030 on or after January 1, 2030, the Notes Due 2040 on or after October 1, 2039, the Notes Due 2050 on or after October 1, 2049, or the Notes Due 2060 on or after October 1, 2059.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Litigation

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants. On March 16, 2020, the Court issued an order dismissing the consolidated class action complaint with leave to amend.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020.  On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants.

On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. On March 12, 2019, the three derivative actions were consolidated under case number 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation. The Court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.

On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the District of Delaware. One is captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is captioned Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. On December 11, 2019, the Court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and Huang actions pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of July 26, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through July 26, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of July 26, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022.

During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 99 million and $ 197 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively.

Note 15 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI, high performance computing, or HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

COVID-19

The coronavirus identified in late calendar year 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a worldwide pandemic. Government authorities around the world have implemented measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.

Our employees and partners are performing above and beyond to keep our supply chain functioning normally. Many industries we serve are adversely impacted, including higher education research, energy, manufacturing, automotive, architecture, engineering, and media. Each industry is recovering, albeit at different rates. Professional Visualization revenue was negatively affected as corporate customers delayed spending on workstations. Automotive production is well below pre-COVID-19 levels.

The full extent and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.

[TABLE_END]

Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $3.87 billion, up 50% from a year earlier and up 26% sequentially. Results for the second quarter include the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27, 2020, the first day of the quarter. Mellanox contributed approximately 14% of total company revenue.

Graphics segment revenue for the second quarter was $2.09 billion, up 16% from a year earlier and up 9% sequentially.

Compute & Networking segment revenue, which includes Mellanox, was $1.78 billion, up 130% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially.

From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $1.65 billion, up 26% from a year ago and up 24% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sales of gaming GPUs. The sequential increase reflects higher sales from gaming GPUs and game console SOCs.

Professional Visualization revenue was $203 million, down 30% from a year earlier and down 34% sequentially.

Data Center revenue, which includes Mellanox, was $1.75 billion, up 167% from a year ago and up 54% sequentially. Mellanox contributed approximately 14% of total company revenue and just over 30% of Data Center revenue for the second quarter. In addition to Mellanox, the year-on-year and sequential increases were driven by the ramp of Ampere GPU architecture products.

Automotive revenue was $111 million, down 47% from a year earlier and down 28% sequentially.

OEM and Other revenue was $146 million, up 32% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially, primarily due to higher demand for entry-level laptop GPUs.

[PAGE BREAK]

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was 58.8%, down 100 basis points from a year earlier and down 630 basis points sequentially, reflecting charges related to the Mellanox acquisition. These include a non-recurring inventory step-up expense of $161 million and intangible asset amortization of $84 million that is expected to be recurring.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 were $1.62 billion, up 67% from a year earlier and up 58% sequentially, primarily driven by our Mellanox acquisition, as well as hiring additional employees.

Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $651 million, up 14% from a year earlier and down 33% sequentially. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $622 million. Net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $0.99, up 10% from a year earlier and down 33% sequentially.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter were $10.98 billion, up from $8.47 billion a year earlier and down from $16.35 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020, offset by acquisitions. The sequential decrease reflects the Mellanox acquisition during the second quarter.

We paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends in the second quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments

29

[PAGE BREAK]

that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Due to the Mellanox acquisition, we added the following critical accounting policy:

Business Combinations

The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility.

There have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. In addition, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

[TABLE_END]

Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased 16% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which reflects growth in GeForce GPUs for gaming, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro workstations and game console SOCs.

Graphics segment revenue increased 20% in the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2020, which reflects growth in GeForce GPUs for gaming, game console SOCs, and Quadro workstations.

Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 increased by 130% and revenue for the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2020 increased by 101%. These increases reflect the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the ramp of Ampere GPU architecture products, partially offset by lower autonomous driving development agreement revenue.

Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 76% and 79% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 93% of total revenue for the second quarter and first

31

[PAGE BREAK]

half of fiscal year 2020. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021. One customer represented 11% of our total revenue for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2020 and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin decreased to 58.8% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 from 59.8% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, reflecting Mellanox acquisition-related costs including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $84 million, partially offset by an increase due to a shift in product mix. Our overall gross margin increased to 61.6% for the first half of fiscal year 2021 from 59.1% for the first half of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by a shift in product mix, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related costs including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $85 million.

Inventory provisions totaled $45 million and $28 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $49 million and $19 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, and an unfavorable impact of 0.4% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.

Inventory provisions totaled $81 million and $72 million for the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $88 million and $31 million for the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in the first half of fiscal year 2021 and an unfavorable impact of 0.9% for the first half of fiscal year 2020.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by a shift in product mix.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by Mellanox acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher data center sales.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by 42% and 26% during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by expenses and

[PAGE BREAK]

stock-based compensation related to the Mellanox acquisition. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 136% and 74% during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by Mellanox acquisition-related expenses. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $13 million and $47 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $44 million and $92 million during the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $54 million and $13 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $78 million and $27 million during the first half of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax benefit of $13 million and an income tax expense of $52 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and an income tax expense of $54 million and $48 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 2.0% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 3.3% for the first half of fiscal year 2021, and 8.8% and 4.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.

[PAGE BREAK]

As of July 26, 2020, we had $10.98 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $84 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Change in working capital was driven by an increase in inventory offset by inventory step-up expense from the Mellanox acquisition and changes in operating liabilities.

Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in the first half of fiscal year 2020, primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox, higher purchases of marketable securities, and lower maturities and sales of marketable securities.

Cash provided by financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in the first half of fiscal year 2020, primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 26, 2020, we had $10.98 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and certificates of deposits. These marketable securities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

We have approximately $857 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the United States. Other than that, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States as of July 26, 2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.

Capital Return to Shareholders

In the first half of fiscal year 2021, we paid $197 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of July 26, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half of fiscal year 2021.

Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities

In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $4.97 billion, after deducting debt discounts and estimated issuance costs.

In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of July 26, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of July 26, 2020, we had not issued any commercial paper.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of July 26, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations.

Contractual Obligations

There are $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of $286 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $41 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of July 26, 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Investment and Interest Rate Risk

Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. As of July 26, 2020, there have been no material changes, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the financial market risks described as of January 26, 2020.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. As of July 26, 2020, there have been no material changes, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 26, 2020.

Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of July 26, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than the acquisition of Mellanox, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.

35

[PAGE BREAK]

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal proceedings since January 26, 2020. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 26, 2020.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 26, 2020. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce. COVID-19 has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 many industries we serve were adversely impacted by COVID-19, including higher education, research, energy, manufacturing, automotive, architecture, engineering and media. These industries may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and may recover at different rates. Our Professional Visualization revenue was negatively affected in the second quarter as corporate customers delayed spending on workstations. Automotive production was and remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. In some regions, the shelter-in-place orders have driven a temporary increase in demand for our products that may not be sustainable.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

36

[PAGE BREAK]

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees in the second quarter continued to work remotely. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.

In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. Factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced demand for some of our products and may continue to do so. In addition, a recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 has and could continue to impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.

Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

37

[PAGE BREAK]

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through July 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In the first half of fiscal year 2021, we paid $197 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of July 26, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half of fiscal year 2021.

Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding

We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 1 million shares at a total cost of $196 million through net share settlements. During the first half of fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $418 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
