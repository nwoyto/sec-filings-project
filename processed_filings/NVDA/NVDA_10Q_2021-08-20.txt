NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

On May 21, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a four -for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend, or the Stock Split, which was conditioned upon obtaining stockholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 2 billion to 4 billion. On June 3, 2021, at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved the amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 4 billion. As a result, each stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.

Significant Accounting Policies

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2022 is a 52-week year and fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. The second quarters of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were both 13-week quarters.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Note 2 - Business Combination

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40 billion. We paid $ 2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 177.5 million shares of our common stock, which had an aggregate value of $ 21.5 billion as of the date of the Purchase Agreement. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $ 5 billion in cash or up to an additional 41.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $ 1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $ 0.17 billion and royalties of $ 0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are working through the regulatory process in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. Although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal rationale and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $ 1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The Signing Consideration was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement.

Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020:

[TABLE_START]

[TABLE_END]

The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 or of the results of our future operations of the combined businesses.

The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $ 161 million in the first half of fiscal year 2020 and was excluded from the pro forma results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments.

Note 6 – Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $ 20 million and $ 153 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $ 13 million and an income tax expense of $ 52 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9 % and 3.4 % for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and 3.3 % for the first half of fiscal year 2021. The income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 2.0 % for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.

On June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. intellectual property to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit primarily from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 252 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.

The increase in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit, and an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, partially offset by the discrete benefit of the Domestication.

Our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that is subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.

Our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the discrete benefit of the Domestication, tax benefits related to the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income

earned in jurisdictions that is subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and tax benefits related to the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock-based compensation.

As of August 1, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.6 billion and $ 231 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

For the first half of fiscal year 2022, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of August 1, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the remaining contracted license, development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of August 1, 2021, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 646 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50 % as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2021.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2021:

[TABLE_END]

As of August 1, 2021, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next 12 months was not significant.

During the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Other purchase obligations totaling $ 565 million are primarily expected to occur over the next 18 months.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 31 million and $ 22 million as of August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2021, respectively, and the activities related to the warranty liabilities were not significant.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Litigation

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On August 11, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of

cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of August 1, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through August 1, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of August 1, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022.

During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, we paid $ 100 million and $ 198 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively.

Note 15 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our two operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking." Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.

Our two operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking," as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid the Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 177.5 million shares of our

24

[PAGE BREAK]

common stock, which had an aggregate value of $21.5 billion as of the date of the Purchase Agreement. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 41.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are working through the regulatory process in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. Although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal rationale and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The Signing Consideration was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement.

Demand

Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Government cryptocurrency policies and regulations may also impact the demand for our products. We have introduced Low Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to direct GeForce to gamers and CMP to miners. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, over 80% of our Ampere architecture-based GeForce GPU shipments in the quarter were LHR GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.

Supply

Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. To have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. We may remain supply-constrained beyond the end of the second half of fiscal year 2022. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our normal lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.

COVID-19

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Some regions are easing COVID-19 related restrictions; however, most of our employees continue to work remotely and we continue to temporarily prohibit most business travel.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and affect our business and financial results. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. As our own offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.

25

[PAGE BREAK]

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors.”

We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations.

We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.

Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $6.51 billion, up 68% from a year earlier.

Gaming revenue was up 85% from a year ago and up 11% sequentially, reflecting higher sales in GeForce GPUs and game-console SOCs. We continued to benefit from strong sales of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. We have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to direct GeForce to gamers and CMP to miners. Over 80% of our Ampere architecture-based GeForce GPU shipments in the quarter were LHR GPUs. CMP is included in OEM.

Data Center revenue was up 35% from a year ago and up 16% sequentially. The year-on-year growth was led by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products into vertical industries and hyperscale customers, including strong growth in inference. Sequentially, growth stemmed from both compute and networking products, led by hyperscale customers.

Professional Visualization revenue was up 156% from a year earlier and up 40% sequentially, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs, with growth led by desktop workstation GPUs.

Automotive revenue was up 37% from a year earlier and down 1% sequentially.  The year-on-year increase was due to the recovery in automotive demand which was impacted by the pandemic in the prior year.

OEM and Other revenue was up 180% from a year ago and up 25% sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in CMP, which generated revenue of $266 million.

GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to a non-recurring inventory step-up expense of $161 million related to the Mellanox acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. GAAP gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially.

Operating expenses for the second quarter were up 9% from a year earlier and up 6% sequentially. The year-on-year and sequential increases were primarily driven by compensation-related costs largely relating to employee growth. The year-on-year increase also reflects growth of infrastructure costs.

26

[PAGE BREAK]

Income from operations was $2.44 billion, up 275% from a year earlier and up 25% sequentially. Net income was $2.37 billion. Net income per diluted share was $0.94, up 276% from a year earlier and up 24% sequentially.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $19.65 billion, up from $10.98 billion a year earlier and up from $12.67 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year and sequential increases reflect $5 billion of debt issuance proceeds and operating cash flow generation.

We paid $100 million in quarterly cash dividends in the second quarter.

Market Platform Highlights

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, in our Gaming platform, we introduced GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti; announced that NVIDIA RTX is featured in 130+ games and applications; announced that NVIDIA Reflex is supported in 20 games, including top e-sports titles; and announced that GeForce NOW gives members access to more than 1,000 PC games.

In our Data Center platform, we unveiled NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command; established the AI LaunchPad hybrid-cloud partner program to offer enterprises instant access to NVIDIA AI infrastructure and software; and announced that NVIDIA technology supports 342 supercomputers on the latest TOP500 list, including 70% of all new systems and 8 of the top 10, and powers 35 of the top 40 greenest systems.

In our Professional Visualization platform, we expanded NVIDIA Omniverse through new integrations with Blender and Adobe, and launched the NVIDIA RTX A2000.

In our Automotive platform, we announced design wins with robotaxi startup AutoX and autonomous trucking platform startup Embark, and collaborated with autonomous trucking company Plus on plans to provide Amazon with at least 1,000 self-driving systems, which are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE.

Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 85% and 86% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and 76% and 79% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2022 or 2021.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin increased to 64.8% and 64.5% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, from 58.8% and 61.6% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively. These increases are primarily due to the absence of a non-recurring inventory step-up expense of $161 million related to the Mellanox acquisition and higher ASPs within desktop GeForce GPUs with continued growth in high-end Ampere architecture products, partially offset by a mix shift within the Compute & Networking segment.

Inventory provisions totaled $73 million and $45 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $20 million and $49 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.8% and insignificant in the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Inventory provisions totaled $131 million and $81 million for the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $41 million and $88 million for the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.7% and insignificant in the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by higher ASPs within desktop GeForce GPUs with continued growth in high-end Ampere architecture products.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by a shift in product mix.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by 25% during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

29

[PAGE BREAK]

Research and development expenses increased by 38% during the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs, and the acquisition of Mellanox.

Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by 16% during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by the impact of employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, and costs related to the pending acquisition of Arm.

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 14% during the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by employee additions and higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, the acquisition of Mellanox, and costs related to the pending acquisition of Arm, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $6 million and $13 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $13 million and $44 million during the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes, March 2020 Notes, and June 2021 Notes. Interest expense was $60 million and $54 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $113 million and $78 million during the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated and equity investments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $4 million and $138 million during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and not significant during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021. The increase during the first half of fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to an unrealized gain from an equity investment. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our equity investment.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $20 million and $153 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $13 million and an income tax expense of $52 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9% and 3.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, and 3.3% for the first half of fiscal year 2021. The income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 2.0% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.

The increase in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit, and an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, partially offset by the discrete benefit of the Domestication. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including the Domestication.

[TABLE_END]

As of August 1, 2021, we had $19.65 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $8.09 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in outstanding trade receivables due to higher revenue and decreased shipment linearity.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to cash used in the first half of fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and higher sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable securities and higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.

Cash provided by financing activities decreased in the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in the first half of fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects higher payments related to tax on restricted stock units.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of August 1, 2021, we had $19.65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months, and for the foreseeable future, including our proposed acquisition of Arm and current and future obligations to secure normal and incremental supply and capacity. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.

We have approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of August 1, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Following the Domestication, we expect to fully utilize our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023.

Capital Return to Shareholders

In the first half of fiscal year 2022, we paid $198 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of August 1, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half of fiscal year 2022.

Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities

As of August 1, 2021, we had outstanding:

• $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2021;

• $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;

On August 16, 2021, we repaid the $1.00 billion of 2.20% Notes Due 2021.

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of August 1, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. The Credit Agreement expires October 2021.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of August 1, 2021, we had not issued any commercial paper.

Contractual Obligations

There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 for a description of our contractual obligations.

Investment and Interest Rate Risk

Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. As of August 1, 2021, there have been no material changes, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the financial market risks described as of January 31, 2021.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of August 1, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

32

[PAGE BREAK]

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal proceedings since January 31, 2021. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 2, 2021.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 2, 2021. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and affect our business and financial results and it has increased the duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty.

In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. The reopening of offices may also generate demand for our products that may be temporary. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters

33

[PAGE BREAK]

is in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Some regions are easing COVID-19 related restrictions; however, most of our employees continue to work remotely and we continue to temporarily prohibit most business travel. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the emergence and spread of new and more contagious or deadly variants or mutant strains of the COVID-19 virus that may render vaccines ineffective or decrease their efficacy, the future spikes of COVID-19 infections or the existence of any additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of breakthrough cases, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, the development, distribution, availability and widespread acceptance of effective vaccines or other treatments and the timing of vaccine rollouts and herd immunity globally, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.

As of August 1, 2021, we had outstanding a total of $12 billion in notes due between 2021 and 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we may have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance notes. If we decide to refinance the notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have entered into a credit agreement that expires in October 2021 under which we may borrow up to $575 million and, subject to obtaining new commitments from lenders under the credit agreement, may borrow up to an additional $425 million under revolving loan commitments. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program. As of August 1, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under the credit agreement or issued any commercial paper. Maintenance of our indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and additional issuances of indebtedness could:

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;

• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

• impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and

34

[PAGE BREAK]

• due to limitations within the debt instruments, restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially change our business or incur subsidiary indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions.

We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and credit agreement. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We hold and may in the future hold investments in publicly traded companies which could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We are working through the regulatory process in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. Discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought and it is it is difficult to predict when the regulatory process will conclude. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration.

The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, such as with respect to the planned Arm acquisition, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

• difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;

• difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;

• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;

• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;

• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;

• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;

• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures;

• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;

• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing;

• the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition;

35

[PAGE BREAK]

• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;

• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;

• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;

• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;

• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and

• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.

Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. We have completed our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, and concluded that there was no adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.

Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through August 1, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In the first half of fiscal year 2022, we paid $198 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of August 1, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half of fiscal year 2022.

Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
