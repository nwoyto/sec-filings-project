NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2020 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report include the financial results of Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, prospectively from April 27, 2020. For additional details, refer to Note 2 - Business Combination.

Significant Accounting Policies

Except for the accounting policies for business combination and investment in non-affiliated entities, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, or IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our condensed consolidated statements of income.

We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. We assess for impairment thereafter. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities

Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year and fiscal year 2020 is a 52-week year. The third quarters of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were both 13-week quarters.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 - Business Combination

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40 billion. We paid $ 2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $ 21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to $ 5 billion in cash or up to 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $ 1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $ 0.17 billion and royalties of $ 0.47 billion. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $ 1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $ 2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

The aggregate purchase consideration has been preliminarily allocated as follows (in millions):

[TABLE_START]
Purchase Price | Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) | $ | 7,033 | Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) | 16 | Total cash consideration | 7,049 | Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) | 85 | Total purchase consideration | $ | 7,134 | Allocation | Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 115 | Marketable securities | 699 | Accounts receivable, net | 216 | Inventories | 320 | Prepaid expenses and other assets | 179 | Property and equipment, net | 144 | Goodwill | 3,431 | Intangible assets | 2,970 | Accounts payable | ( | 136 | ) | Accrued and other current liabilities | ( | 236 | ) | Income tax liability | ( | 191 | ) | Deferred income tax liability | ( | 258 | ) | Other long-term liabilities | ( | 119 | ) | $ | 7,134
[TABLE_END]

(1)    Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.

(2)    Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.

(3)    Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.

We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their estimated fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of the acquisition and are subject to change during the measurement period which is not expected to exceed one year. The primary tasks that are required to be completed include validation of business level forecasts, jurisdictional forecasts, customer attrition rates, contingent liabilities assessments and any related tax impacts from the acquisition. Any adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period will be recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill

arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 15 – Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 13 % and 10 % of consolidated revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 27 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021.

Intangible Assets

The estimated fair value and weighted average useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:

[TABLE_START]
Fair Value | Weighted Average Useful Lives | (In millions) | Developed technology (1) | $ | 1,640 | 5 | years | Customer relationships (2) | 440 | 3 | years | Order backlog (3) | 190 | Based on actual shipments | Trade names (4) | 70 | 5 | years | Total identified finite-lived intangible assets | 2,340 | IPR&D (5) | 630 | N/A | Total identified intangible assets | $ | 2,970
[TABLE_END]

(1)    The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

(2)    Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.

(3)    Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

(4)    Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach.

(5)    The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.

The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.

Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 630 million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project will be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $ 161 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 and were excluded from the pro forma results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments.

Note 3 - Leases

Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of October 25, 2020, are as follows:

Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

Note 5 – Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

[TABLE_END]

(1)    Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.

(2)    Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.

Note 6 – Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $ 12 million and $ 64 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and $ 60 million and $ 109 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9 % and 2.2 % for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 6.3 % and 5.6 % for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $ 256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $ 153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. Upon finalization of the purchase price allocation, additional adjustments to the amount of our net deferred taxes and long-term tax liabilities may be required. As a result of the acquisition, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 675 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

For the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we assumed $ 59 million of unrecognized tax

benefits and $ 4 million of related interest through the Mellanox acquisition. Other than these amounts, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities.  As of October 25, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the remaining contracted license, development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of October 25, 2020, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 679 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 41 % as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 25, 2020 and January 26, 2020.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including intercompany hedging instruments, or intercompany derivatives, with wholly-owned subsidiaries in order to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 25, 2020 and January 26, 2020:

As of October 25, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months . The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Note 12 - Debt

Long-Term Debt

In March 2020, we issued $ 1.50 billion of the 2.85 % Notes Due 2030, $ 1.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2040, $ 2.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2050, and $ 500 million of the 3.70 % Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. Interest on the March 2020 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2020. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2030 on or after January 1, 2030, the Notes Due 2040 on or after October 1, 2039, the Notes Due 2050 on or after October 1, 2049, or the Notes Due 2060 on or after October 1, 2059. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $ 4.97 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.

In September 2016, we issued $ 1.00 billion of the 2.20 % Notes Due 2021 and $ 1.00 billion of the 3.20 % Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. Interest on the September 2016 Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year.

whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $ 1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.

Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:

Litigation

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020.  The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants.  As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.  The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of October 25, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through October 25, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of October 25, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022.

During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 99 million and $ 296 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively.

Note 15 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI, high performance computing, or HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Note 16 - Goodwill

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to Graphics and Compute & Networking, as discussed in Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of October 25, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $ 347 million and $ 3.85 billion, respectively. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, goodwill increased by $ 3.57 billion. The increase in goodwill in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 was due to goodwill of $ 3.43 billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $ 133 million from other acquisition activity, both of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit.

Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.

Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, our reportable segments have changed to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking".

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to $5 billion in cash or up to 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

COVID-19

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.

Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, stronger demand for mobile workstations due to work from home trends was partially offset by lower demand for desktop workstations. In Automotive, customers' production volumes have largely returned to pre-COVID levels. In our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.

[PAGE BREAK]

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $4.73 billion, up 57% from a year earlier and up 22% sequentially.

Graphics segment revenue was $2.79 billion, up 25% from a year earlier and up 34% sequentially.

Compute & Networking segment revenue was $1.94 billion, up 146% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially.

From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $2.27 billion, up 37% both from a year ago and sequentially. The increases reflect higher sales across desktop and notebook gaming GPUs, and game console SOCs. Desktop gaming sales benefited from the launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

Professional Visualization revenue was $236 million, down 27% from a year earlier and up 16% sequentially. The year-on-year decline was influenced by COVID-19, with reduced demand for desktop workstations. The sequential increase reflects a sharp rebound in mobile workstations due to work from home trends.

Data Center revenue was $1.90 billion, up 162% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. Our recent acquisition of Mellanox contributed 13% of total company revenue and approximately a third of Data Center revenue. In addition to Mellanox, the year-on-year and sequential increases were driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products.

Automotive revenue was $125 million, down 23% from a year earlier and up 13% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects a decline in revenue from legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements. The sequential increase reflects higher sales of AI cockpit solutions.

OEM and Other revenue was $194 million, up 36% from a year ago and up 33% sequentially, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.

Gross margin was 62.6% in the third quarter, down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 380 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects charges related to the Mellanox acquisition and lower margins in Gaming, partially offset by a shift in product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive sales. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the absence of a non-recurring inventory step-up expense related to the Mellanox acquisition in the prior quarter.

Operating expenses were $1.56 billion, up 58% from a year earlier and down 4% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by compensation-related costs, the Mellanox acquisition, infrastructure costs, and employee growth. The sequential decrease was due to a reduction in acquisition-related costs.

Income from operations was $1.40 billion, up 51% from a year earlier and up 115% sequentially. Net income was $1.34 billion. Net income per diluted share was $2.12, up 46% from a year earlier and up 114% sequentially.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter were $10.14 billion, up from $9.77 billion a year earlier and down from $10.98 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cash flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the $2 billion payment under the Purchase Agreement to acquire Arm.

We paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends in the third quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Due to the Mellanox acquisition, we added the following critical accounting policy:

Business Combinations

The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility.

There have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. In addition, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

[TABLE_END]

Graphics - Graphics segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 increased by 25% and revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 increased by 22%. These increases reflect growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro workstations.

Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 increased by 146% and revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 increased by 117%. These increases reflect the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products, partially offset by lower autonomous driving development agreement revenue.

Concentration of Revenue

30

[PAGE BREAK]

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 80% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 92% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021. One customer represented 10% and 11% of our total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin decreased to 62.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 from 63.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, reflecting charges related to the Mellanox acquisition and lower margins in Gaming, partially offset by a shift in product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive sales. Our overall gross margin increased to 62.0% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 from 60.8% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by Mellanox products, lower Automotive sales and lower product costs within Compute & Networking, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related costs including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $171 million.

Inventory provisions totaled $15 million and $42 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $29 million and $78 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was a favorable impact of 0.3% and 1.2% in the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Inventory provisions totaled $96 million and $114 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $116 million and $109 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was a favorable impact of 0.2% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 and an unfavorable impact of 0.1% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by a shift in product mix and higher product costs. The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by lower legacy infotainment sales and product mix within Quadro.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by Mellanox products and lower product costs.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by 47% and 33% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by expenses related to the Mellanox acquisition. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.

Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 86% and 78% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by Mellanox acquisition-related expenses. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $7 million and $45 million during the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $50 million and $137 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $53 million and $13 million during the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $131 million and $39 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $12 million and $64 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and $60 million and $109 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9% and 2.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 6.3% and 5.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

[TABLE_END]

As of October 25, 2020, we had $10.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $758 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in $1.36 billion advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and $0.47 billion prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in outstanding trade receivables, purchases of inventory, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm.

Cash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher maturities of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities.

Cash provided by financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and payments related to tax on restricted stock units.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of October 25, 2020, we had $10.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

We have approximately $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the United States. Other than that, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the

United States as of October 25, 2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.

Capital Return to Shareholders

In the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we paid $296 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of October 25, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first nine months of fiscal year 2021.

Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities

In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $4.97 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.

In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of October 25, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 25, 2020, we had not issued any commercial paper.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of October 25, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations.

Contractual Obligations

There are $155 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of $310 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $46 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of October 25, 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of October 25, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 26, 2020 and July 26, 2020.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 26, 2020 and July 26, 2020. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments, including the Mellanox and Arm acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion on April 27, 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the Arm acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

• difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;

• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;

• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;

• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;

• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;

• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures;

• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;

• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing;

• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;

• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;

• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;

• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;

36

[PAGE BREAK]

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;

• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and

• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce. COVID-19 has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform experienced stronger demand for mobile workstations due to work from home trends, but was negatively affected by lower corporate demand for desktop workstations. Industry production volume returned to pre-COVID levels in our Auto market platform, but these production volumes may be further impacted by COVID-19. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees in the third quarter continued to work remotely. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.

In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the

disease or treat its impact, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including,  but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.  All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
