CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

​

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these particular words.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and other plans and objectives for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained herein are largely based on our expectations for the future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends, and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate.

We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including access to premium products, volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or the ability to cancel orders or return merchandise; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; a recession, volatility in the financial markets, and other global economic factors, including inflation; difficulties in appropriately allocating capital and resources among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; cash management; liquidity; cash flow from operations; our ability to access the credit markets at competitive terms; borrowing capacity under our credit facility; repatriation of cash to the United States; supply chain issues; labor shortages and wage pressures; consumer spending levels; the effect of certain governmental assistance programs; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the effect of increased government regulation, compliance, and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us or judicial decisions that affect us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; climate change; ESG risks; increased competition; geopolitical events; the financial effect of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance.

Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investment in our securities. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this report, or any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Foot Locker, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), is a leading footwear and apparel retailer. We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, and social channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our distribution centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on availability of particular items. We operate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, representing our operating segments. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year. Additionally, the results of operations for the period ended July 29, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may affect us for the remainder of the year. Fiscal year 2023 will include the 53 -week period that ends on February 3, 2024 .

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2022 Form 10 -K. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. In 2023, we separately present licensing revenue as a component of total revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, as previously licensing revenue was presented within other income / (expense), net.

There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2022 Form 10 -K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

2. Revenue

8. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were as follows:

[TABLE_START]
($ in millions) | July 29, 2023 | July 30, 2022 | Carrying value | (1) | $ | 395 | $ | 394 | Fair value | $ | 312 | $ | 313

[TABLE_START]
( | 1 | ) | The carrying value of debt as of | July 29, 2023 | and | July 30, 2022 | included $ | 5 | million and $ | 6 | million of issuer’s discount and costs, respectively.
[TABLE_END]

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and other current receivables and payables approximate their fair value.

9. Earnings Per Share

We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS. The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Restricted stock units (“RSU”) are awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and nonemployee directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to officers and certain key employees in connection with our long-term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied. PSU awards granted in 2022 and 2023 also include a performance objective based on our relative total shareholder return over the performance period to a pre-determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant and share-based compensation expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual awards.

11. Share-Based Compensation (continued)

Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for employees and one year for nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to the terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the relevant performance period and vest after an additional one -year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.

RSU and PSU activity for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 is summarized as follows:

The total value of RSU and PSU awards that vested during the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022 was $ 23 million and $ 6 million, respectively. As of July 29, 2023 , there was $ 31 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards.

12. Legal Proceedings

Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims. Additionally, the Company is a defendant in two purported class actions alleging wage/hour and wage statement violations in California.

We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

We have a strong history of sneaker authority that sparks discovery and ignites the power of sneaker culture through our portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and atmos.

Ensuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our website, or on our mobile application, is a high priority for us. We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners. These sites offer some of the largest online product selections and provide a seamless link between e-commerce and physical stores.

Store Count

At July 29, 2023, we operated 2,599 stores as compared with 2,714 and 2,799 stores at January 28, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.

Franchise Operations

A total of 184 franchised stores were operating at July 29, 2023, as compared with 159 and 148 stores at January 28, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively, operating in the Middle East and Asia. These stores are not included in the operating store count above.

Results of Operations

We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

The table below summarizes our results for the period.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.

These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.

The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition, and not as an alternative, to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP.

The adjustments made to other income / (expense), net primarily reflected gains or losses associated with our minority investments and gains on sales of businesses. See the Other Income / (Expense), net section for further information.

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we recorded a $4 million benefit related to an income tax reserves release from a statute of limitations expiration.

Segment Reporting and Results of Operations

We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Kids Foot Locker, and WSS, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as atmos, which operates primarily in Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we planned to close our Sidestep banner and certain stores operating in Asia. During the second quarter of 2023 we substantially closed the Sidestep banner and the stores operating in Hong Kong and Macau. Additionally during the second quarter, we sold our Singapore and Malaysian business to our license partner. Our license partner will operate those stores under a licensing agreement.

Sales

​

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

Sales from acquired businesses that include inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store sales after the 15th month of operations. Accordingly, both WSS and atmos are included in the computation.

For the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, total sales decreased by $204 million, or 9.9%, to $1,861 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, total sales decreased by $452 million, or 10.7%, to $3,788 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased by $209 million, or 10.2%, for the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, and decreased by $426 million, or 10.0%, for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel.

[TABLE_END]

From a product perspective for the combined channels, the sales declines in the quarter and year-to-date were across all categories of footwear, apparel and accessories.

Comparable sales decreased both in our stores and in our direct-to-customer channels this quarter and for the year to date due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, which affected customer traffic and conversion, as well as changing vendor mix coupled with our repositioning of the Champs Sports banner. We are repositioning the Champs Sports banner to serve the active athlete, which resulted in expected comparable sales declines due to the transition. In addition, North America sales were negatively affected by the closure of Eastbay business, which ceased operating in late 2022. Eastbay's sales primarily represent the other category in the above table, and excluding those sales the decline would have been 10.7% and 10.9%, on a constant currency basis, for the quarter and year-to-date period of 2023, respectively. Within EMEA, constant currency sales for the Foot Locker banners increased, led by our operations in France and Italy as tourism has increased as compared with last year, partially offsetting this was the decline in sales in our Sidestep banner due to the planned closure. For our Asia Pacific operating segment, for both the quarter and the year-to-date period, sales increased in our operations in Australia and South Korea, while our sales in New Zealand were relatively flat. As previously announced, we have closed our operations in Hong Kong and Macau, which negatively affected sales. During the second quarter, we sold our businesses operating in Singapore and Malaysia to our licensing partner. Our sales of our atmos banner decreased by 10.0% and 1.8% on a comparable basis, for the quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, as this banner was affected negatively by the lack of certain key styles from adidas that were available in the marketplace last year.

Gross Margin

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | July 29, | July 30, | July 29, | July 30, | ​ | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | Gross margin rate | 27.1 | % | 31.7 | % | 28.6 | % | 32.9 | % | Basis point decrease in the gross margin rate | (460 | ) | ​ | (430 | ) | ​ | Components of the change: | ​ | ​ | ​ | Merchandise margin rate decline | (300 | ) | ​ | (280 | ) | ​ | Higher occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense rate | (160 | ) | ​ | (150 | ) | ​
[TABLE_END]

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

Second Quarter 2023 Form 10-Q Page 18

[PAGE BREAK]

Table of Contents

The gross margin rate decreased to 27.1% for the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 300-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and a 160-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, gross margin rate decreased by 430 basis points, reflecting a 280-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and a 150-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate. The declines in merchandise margin rate reflected higher promotional activity in the current marketplace, higher costs of merchandise, and increased shrink. The deleverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate was primarily related to the fixed nature of these costs in relation to the decline in sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | July 29, | July 30, | July 29, | July 30, | ($ in millions) | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | SG&A | $ | 442 | $ | 452 | $ | 873 | $ | 915 | $ Change | $ | (10 | ) | ​ | $ | (42 | ) | ​ | % Change | (2.2 | )% | ​ | (4.6 | )% | ​ | SG&A as a percentage of sales | 23.8 | % | 21.9 | % | 23.0 | % | 21.6 | %
[TABLE_END]

SG&A decreased by $10 million, or $14 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, for the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the year-to-date period, SG&A decreased by $42 million, or $39 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 190 basis points and 140 basis points for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively, primarily reflecting deleverage from the decline in sales, coupled with pressures from inflation and investments in front-line wages and technology aimed at improving the omnichannel experience and improving customer data analytics. Partially offsetting these increases was lower incentive compensation due to the Company's underperformance relative to targets and savings from our cost optimization program.

Depreciation and Amortization

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | July 29, | July 30, | July 29, | July 30, | ($ in millions) | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | Depreciation and amortization | $ | 50 | $ | 51 | $ | 101 | $ | 105 | $ Change | $ | (1 | ) | $ | (4 | ) | % Change | (2.0 | )% | (3.8 | )%
[TABLE_END]

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1 million and $4 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization decreased by $2 million and $4 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively. These declines are primarily related to operating fewer stores and the effect from impairments recorded in the prior year.

Impairment and Other

For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we incurred $7 million and $26 million of transformation consulting expense, respectively, as compared with $9 million and $10 million in the corresponding prior-year periods. We recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $21 million, respectively, primarily accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for the closures of the Sidestep banner and Foot Locker Asia stores, as compared with impairment of $2 million and $5 million in the prior year periods, mainly from the closure of Footaction stores. Additionally, we recorded reorganization costs of $3 million and $5 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively, related to the announced closure of the Sidestep banner, Foot Locker Asia stores, and a North American distribution center, as well as $1 million in other charges. In the comparative periods ended July 30, 2022, we incurred $1 million and $3 million of acquisition integration costs related to WSS and atmos.

[TABLE_END]

Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items.

Corporate expense decreased by $27 million and $60 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $9 million and $10 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively and $18 million and $19 million for the year-to-date periods, respectively. Corporate expense decreased primarily due to an increase in the allocation of corporate expense to the banners in 2023 and lower incentive compensation, including share-based compensation that is tied to performance, partially offset by our ongoing investments in information technology.

Division profit margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 1.1% and 3.3% for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively, with both channels experiencing declines in sales coupled with lower gross margins due to the promotional environment and deleveraging expenses.

Interest expense for both the quarter and year-to-date period decreased primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents related to higher interest rates and income from our cross-currency swap.

The thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 reflected expense of $2 million and $4 million, respectively, related to our pension and postretirement programs, offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of our Foot Locker Singapore and Malaysia businesses to our license partner in the second quarter. The corresponding prior-year periods primarily represented a decrease in the fair value of our former investment in Retailors, Ltd., offset by an $18 million gain on the divestiture of the Eastbay Team Sales business.

Income Taxes

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | July 29, | July 30, | July 29, | July 30, | ($ in millions) | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | Provision for income taxes | $ | 2 | $ | 49 | $ | 23 | $ | 107 | Effective tax rate | (98.5 | )% | 34.5 | % | 42.7 | % | 32.1 | %
[TABLE_END]

Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate, which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented.

We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation.

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we recorded a $4 million reserve release from a statute of limitations expiration on our foreign income taxes. Excluding this item, and other insignificant reserve releases due to settlements of international tax examinations, the effective tax rate for the current year period increased, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to the decline in income before tax and a change in geographic mix of earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies, including strategic investments.

We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements.

The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of July 29, 2023, approximately $1,103 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program.

Our full-year capital spending is expected to be $265 million. The forecast includes $200 million related to the remodeling or relocation of approximately 200 existing stores and the opening of approximately 80 new stores, including 25 WSS stores. Additionally, we expect to spend $65 million for the development of information systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives. We also expect to spend an additional $25 million in software-as-a-service contracts related to our technology initiatives.

On August 15, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share, which will be payable on October 27, 2023 to shareholders on record as of October 13, 2023. The Board of Directors regularly reviews the dividend policy and rate. Given the current environment and in order to provide us with flexibility, the Board of Directors has decided to pause the dividend program at this time.

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the headings “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Risk Factors” could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

[TABLE_END]

Operating activities reflects net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include impairment charges, other charges, fair value adjustments to minority investments, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.

The decrease in cash from operating activities reflected lower net income, partially offset by timing of merchandise purchases and payments of accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, as compared with the same period last year. The prior-year merchandise purchases were affected by the supply chain disruptions that occurred in the preceding year.

Investing Activities

[TABLE_START]
​ | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | July 29, | July 30, | ($ in millions) | 2023 | 2022 | Net cash used in investing activities | $ | (96 | ) | $ | (113 | ) | $ Change | $ | 17 | ​
[TABLE_END]

The change in investing activities primarily reflected lower capital expenditures in the current year. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, capital expenditures decreased by $51 million to $105 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. The prior year amount was elevated as several large projects related to 2021 were paid in the first quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses. During the second quarter of 2023, we sold our businesses operating in Singapore and Malaysia for total cash consideration of $23 million and received proceeds of $18 million, or $10 million net of cash. The amounts are subject to the finalization of net working capital. The prior year amount represented the divestiture of Team Sales for total proceeds of $47 million.

Financing Activities

[TABLE_END]

Cash used in financing activities was primarily related to our return to shareholders initiatives as follows:

[TABLE_END]

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase program, whereas in the prior year we spent $129 million to repurchase shares. We declared and paid $75 million in dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.40 per share in both the twenty-six weeks of 2023 and 2022. We paid $10 million and $1 million during the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively, to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to vesting of share-based equity awards.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

During the quarter, the Company’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). The term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of April 29, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the un-remediated material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to certain ineffective general information technology controls over logical access and change management at our WSS business, which was previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023. For additional information, please refer to Part II - Item 9A. of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023.

Remediation

Management is in the process of implementing measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) designing and implementing controls related to deprovisioning, privileged access, and user access reviews, (ii) developing an enhanced risk assessment process to evaluate logical access, and (iii) improving the existing training program associated with control design and implementation. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses. Management began to implement certain of these remedial steps during the first and second quarters of 2023. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of 2023.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), during the quarter ended July 29, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Because of its inherent limitations, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
