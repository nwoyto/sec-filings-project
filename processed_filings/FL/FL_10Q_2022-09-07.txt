CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

​

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these particular words.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and other plans and objectives for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained herein are largely based on our expectations for the future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends, and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate.

We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including the unavailability of premium products at competitive prices, volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or ability to cancel orders and return merchandise; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors; difficulties in appropriately allocating capital and resources among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; liquidity; cash flow from operations; use of cash and cash requirements; borrowing capacity; repatriation of cash to the United States; supply chain issues, including delays in merchandise receipts and increasing cost pressure caused by higher oceanic shipping and freight costs; labor shortages; expectations regarding increased wages; inflation; consumer spending levels; the effect of governmental assistance programs; social unrest; continuing risks relating to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccines and safety protocols; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the effect of increased government regulation and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us or judicial decisions that affect us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; climate change; ESG risks; increased competition; geopolitical events; the financial effect of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance. The Company does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document. See “Risk Factors” included in the Annual Report for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investment in our securities. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable, and take advantage of, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.

Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this report, or any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. As used in these Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the terms “Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year.

The results of operations for the period ended July 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may affect us for the remainder of 2022.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Form 10-K.

There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisitions

In 2021, we acquired WSS and atmos, two businesses that will allow us to further differentiate our product offerings, as well as our customer base, and diversify our retail store and omnichannel portfolio.

WSS

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, we paid an additional $ 4 million upon the finalization of the value of net assets acquired, with a corresponding increase to goodwill as compared with the amounts presented in the most recent annual report. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition has increased to $ 811 million ($ 741 million, net of cash acquired). There were no additional payments or changes to the value of net assets acquired in the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022.

[TABLE_END]

​

atmos

During the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, we paid an additional $ 5 million and $ 8 million, respectively, in connection with the finalization of certain post-closing conditions. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition has increased to $ 368 million, subject to adjustment for the finalization of the value of net assets acquired and other post-closing matters. The preliminary purchase price includes contingent consideration initially measured at $ 35 million, which can reach up to $ 111 million based on achieving certain revenue growth and EBITDA performance targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration has not changed from the initial measurement. The preliminary purchase price does not yet reflect the finalization of the net working capital provisions and other post-closing adjustments. At closing, we placed $ 30 million in escrow, and an additional $ 6 million will be payable if certain post-closing conditions are satisfied. We expect to finalize the remaining amounts by the end of this fiscal year.

The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for atmos and includes fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities since our most recent annual report. Changes to amounts reported at year end and the previous quarter included an $ 8 million increase in goodwill due to the additional purchase price, revised downward valuation of the tradenames and the addition of the customer list intangible. The adjustments did not have a significant effect on the consolidated results of operations. We determined that the atmos tradenames will have an indefinite life and will not be amortized.

We are assessing the tax deductibility of the goodwill related to the acquisition.

Contract Liabilities

We sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift cards are redeemed by customers. Breakage income is recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer . The table below presents the activity of our gift card liability balance.

We elected not to disclose the information about remaining performance obligations since the amount of gift cards redeemed after 12 months is not significant.

4. Segment Information

We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, and social channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our distribution centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on availability.

We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

8. Goodwill

See footnote 2, Acquisitions , for additional information on our recent acquisitions.

In conjunction with the sale of the Eastbay Team Sales business, we allocated $ 6 million of goodwill to the assets sold, representing the allocable share of the fair value of the reporting unit disposed of.

We review goodwill for impairment annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The review of impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test.

11. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Fair Value Hedge

On May 6, 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap contract to reduce the effect of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar (“USD”) to Japanese Yen (“JPY”) foreign exchange rate on our foreign currency-denominated intercompany loan between our Japanese and U.S. subsidiary. We expect the gains and losses on this contract to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from the remeasurement of the principal and interest accrued on the loan. Though the intercompany loan eliminates in consolidation, the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan and interest by the U.S. subsidiary is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

The cross-currency swap contract has a notional amount of JPY 11 billion and final receipt of $ 85 million. The cross-currency swap contract, which matures on November 2, 2031, swaps Yen-denominated interest payments for U.S. dollar-denominated interest payments, thereby economically converting the JPY 11 billion fixed-rate 3.51 % intercompany loan to a fixed-rate 6.77 % USD-denominated receivable for our U.S. subsidiary.

We designated the cross-currency swap contract to hedge the changes in value of the intercompany loan and its variability on earnings. We will apply fair value hedge accounting, and we will consider market factors other than the change in the spot exchange rate on the notional amount of the swap to be excluded components. The foreign currency spot rate fluctuations on the cross-currency swap notional amount and interest accruals are reported in earnings each period, while all other changes are reported in other comprehensive income. Because the terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument match and the likelihood of swap counterparty default is not probable, the hedge is expected to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the foreign currency debt resulting from to foreign currency fluctuations over the term of the swap.

As of July 30, 2022, the cross-currency swap had a fair value of $ 1 million and was included in other assets. We record the changes in the fair value of the contract to AOCL. Each period, we reclassify an amount out of AOCL equal to the remeasurement gain or loss on the hedged intercompany loan that is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of July 30, 2022, there was $ 3 million in AOCL, net of tax, related to the cross-currency swap. In addition, we recognize swap interest income based on the differential in fixed interest rates per the contract. For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, we recorded $ 1 million of income in interest expense, net. Refer to Note 10 for further information regarding amounts recorded in AOCL.

12. Fair Value Measurements

Our financial assets are recorded at fair value, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are categorized as follows:

[TABLE_START]
Level 1 | – | Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
[TABLE_END]

[TABLE_START]
Level 2 – | Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
[TABLE_END]

[TABLE_START]
Level 3 – | Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.

12. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

In 2021, we invested $ 68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd, which is traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment is classified as a Level 1 instrument since the fair value is readily available in an active market.

The fair value of the auction rate security, classified as available-for-sale, is determined by using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.

The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the atmos acquisition is estimated using an option pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations.

Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility and, therefore, are classified as Level 2 instruments.

​

There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets and liabilities for any of the periods presented.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These assets are measured using Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired.

Minority investments measured using the fair value measurement alternative had a carrying value of $ 579 million and $ 612 million as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The balance as of July 30, 2022 includes the $ 400 million 4 % Notes. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were as follows:

[TABLE_END]

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and other current receivables and payables approximate their fair value.

13. Earnings Per Share

We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS.

The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Performance stock units related to our long-term incentive programs of 0.8 million and 0.6 million have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares for the periods ended July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively. The issuance of these shares is contingent on our performance metrics as compared to the pre-established performance goals, which have not been achieved.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Restricted stock units (“RSU”) are awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and nonemployee directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to officers and certain key employees in connection with our long-term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied. PSU awards granted in 2022 also include a performance objective based on our relative total shareholder return over the performance period to a pre-determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant and share-based compensation expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual awards.

Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for employees and one year for nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to the terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the relevant performance period and vest after an additional one-year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

15. Share-Based Compensation (continued)

The total value of RSU and PSU awards that vested during the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021 was $ 6 million and $ 22 million, respectively. As of July 30, 2022, there was $ 44 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards.

16. Legal Proceedings

Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims.

We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Foot Locker, Inc. leads the celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe through a portfolio of brands including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Eastbay, atmos, WSS, Footaction, and Sidestep. As of July 30, 2022, we operated 2,799 primarily mall-based stores, as well as stores in high-traffic urban retail areas and high streets, in 28 countries across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as websites and mobile apps. Our purpose is to inspire and empower youth culture around the world, by fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled experiences at the heart of the global sneaker community.

We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners including footlocker.com, kidsfootlocker.com, champssports.com, atmosusa.com, shopwss.com and related e-commerce sites in the various international countries that we operate. These sites offer some of the largest online product selections and provide a seamless link between e-commerce and physical stores. We also operate the website for eastbay.com.

Store Count

At July 30, 2022, we operated 2,799 stores as compared with 2,858 and 2,911 stores at January 29, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.

Franchise Operations

A total of 148 franchised stores were operating at July 30, 2022, as compared with 142 and 134 stores at January 29, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively, operating in the Middle East and Asia. Revenue from franchised stores was not significant for any of the periods presented. These stores are not included in the operating store count above.

COVID-19 Update

We continue to monitor outbreaks of COVID-19 which cause store closures, reduced operating hours, capacity limitations, and social distancing that may be required to help ensure the health and safety of our team members and our customers. COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an effect on ports and trade, as well as global travel.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.

​

Table of Contents

These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period. The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective with the first quarter of 2022, the calculation for non-GAAP earnings excludes gains and losses from all minority investments, including the adjustments related to the investment in Retailors, Ltd. We believe this is a more representative measure of our recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results, and is consistent with how management reviews performance. The non-GAAP results for 2021 have been recast, as applicable, to conform to the current year’s presentation. As we report quarterly results through 2022, we will provide updated non-GAAP reconciliations for the corresponding prior year’s quarter under this revised definition.

Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP.

The adjustments made to other income / (expense), net reflect gains or losses primarily associated with our minority investments. See the Other Income / (Expense), net section for further information.

In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the resolution of a foreign tax settlement.

Segment Reporting

We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Footaction, including each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as atmos, which operates primarily in Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Results of Operations

We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

The table below summarizes our results.

Sales

​

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Stores that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic are also included in the computation of comparable-store sales. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

Sales from acquired businesses that include inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store sales after 15 months of operations. Accordingly, sales of WSS and atmos have been excluded from the computation of comparable-store sales. As a result of the Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, sales from this business were removed for the computation of comparable sales for all periods.

The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel.

For the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, total sales decreased by $210 million, or 9.2%, to $2,065 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, total sales decreased by $188 million, or 4.2%, to $4,240 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased by $139 million, or 6.1%, for the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, and decreased by $76 million, or 1.7%, for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022. Sales from our acquired WSS and atmos banners were $137 million and $48 million, respectively, for the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, and $275 million and $101 million, respectively for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022.

Despite the decline in sales as compared with our record levels in 2021, sales exceeded the results of 2019. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our acquisitions, sales increased by 7.4% and by 1.1% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as compared with the corresponding periods of 2019.

Comparable sales for both our stores and direct-to-customer channels decreased for the quarter. Our direct-to-customer channel saw significant decreases as shoppers navigated back to physical locations. For the year-to-date period, comparable sales were slightly up for our stores, while direct-to-customer decreased when compared with the prior year.

Our North American operating segment’s sales, excluding WSS, and comparable-store sales for the current year were negatively affected by the significant fiscal stimulus, which contributed to last year’s growth, as well as the effects of inflation on customer demand. Additionally, the wind down of the Footaction business negatively affected sales, last year we operated 211 stores as compared with 14 this quarter. Within EMEA, sales from the Foot Locker and Sidestep banners increased as tourism returned to more historical levels coupled with an increase in operating days resulting from COVID-19 related store closures in the prior year. Asia Pacific, excluding atmos, generated increases from both strong performance in Australia and New Zealand, coupled with growth in Asia, based on expansion in that region. Asia Pacific’s increases were also affected by the increase in operating days, the current year was essentially open for all days as compared with approximately 80% last year.

From a product perspective for the combined channels, sales declined for both the quarter and year-to-date periods and was related to decreased sales of footwear and apparel, partially offset by increased sales of accessories. The decline in footwear for the second quarter was primarily due to men’s and kids’ basketball footwear, and the decline in sales of apparel represented a decline in sales of men’s and performance apparel, however sales of women’s apparel generated an increase. For the year-to-date period, all wearer segments within the footwear category experienced declines, with the largest decreases coming from men’s and children’s basketball footwear styles. Apparel sales decreased in the men’s and children’s categories, while women’s increased.

Gross Margin

[TABLE_END]

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

The gross margin rate decreased to 31.7% for the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 260-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and an 80-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, the gross margin rate declined by 200 basis points, reflecting a 160-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and a 40-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate.

Second Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 24

[PAGE BREAK]

Table of Contents

The declines in merchandise margin rate reflected higher markdowns versus historically-low levels last year and higher supply chain costs. Additionally, merchandise margin is negatively affected by the recent acquisitions that generate a lower rate, which is offset by lower occupancy costs and therefore not significantly affecting the overall gross margin rate. The occupancy rate deleverage also reflected the effect of prior year rent abatements related to COVID-19 that represented $6 million and $11 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks of last year, respectively, as compared with insignificant amounts this year.

SG&A increased by $2 million, or $22 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, for the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the year-to-date period SG&A increased by $47 million, or $77 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Our newly acquired businesses contributed $38 million and $72 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, to the overall increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 210 basis points and 200 basis points for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively, driven by higher labor costs, information technology and support expenses, as well as the effect of COVID-19 related matters in the prior year.

SG&A for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022 included nominal payroll subsidies from local governments, compared with $4 million and $14 million for the corresponding prior-year periods, respectively.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3 million and $12 million for the thirteen weeks and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization increased by $5 million and $15 million for the thirteen weeks and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. The increase was primarily related to the acquisitions of WSS and atmos.

Impairment and Other Charges

Transformation consulting charges were $9 million and $10 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets was $2 million and $5 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively, and $39 million for both the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 31, 2021.

These increases were primarily due to higher information technology and support expenses.

This caption includes non-operating items, including franchise royalty income, changes in fair value of minority investments measured at fair value or using the fair value measurement alternative, changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security, our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investments, and net benefit (expense) related to our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component.

The thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022 reflected a gain of $18 million from the divestiture of Eastbay Team Sales, $13 million loss related to a decline in the fair value of our Retailors, Ltd. investment, partially offset by $1 million of income associated with our other minority investments. The twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022 reflected the gain from the divestiture of $18 million, a decline in our Retailors, Ltd. investment of $38 million, offset by $1 million of dividend income, and $1 million of income from our other minority investments. The prior year amounts included a gain of $290 million representing the fair value adjustment of our minority investment in GOAT, a gain of $24 million related to our Retailors, Ltd. investment, $4 million insurance recovery related to the 2020 social unrest, and $2 million of income associated with our other minority investments. These were all considered our non-GAAP adjustments in all of the periods presented.

Other income / (expense), net also includes $3 million and $6 million of franchise income for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, respectively. The year-to-date period also includes a charge of $1 million related to our auction rate security.

Income Taxes

[TABLE_END]

Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate, which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented.

We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. The changes in tax reserves were not significant for any of the periods presented.

In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the resolution of a foreign tax settlement.  Partially offsetting this charge were tax benefits totaling $2 million from reserves releases due to various statute of limitation lapses. The changes in tax reserves were not significant for any of the prior-year periods.

During the quarter ended July 30, 2022, we also recorded a tax expense of $6 million in connection with Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, including the effect of a non-deductible goodwill write-off.

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, we recorded $1 million of expense related to tax deficiencies from share-based compensation, as compared with excess tax benefits of $1 million and $2 million in the first and second quarters of the corresponding prior-year periods, respectively.

Excluding the above-mentioned discrete items, the effective tax rates for the current year periods increased, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods, primarily due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings.

Our effective tax rate will vary due to numerous factors, such as level and geographic mix of income and losses, acquisitions, investments, intercompany transactions, foreign currency exchange rates, our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 into law. The IRA contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not currently expect the IRA tax provisions will have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies, including strategic investments. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements.

The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of July 30, 2022, approximately $1,103 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in February 2022. The new program does not have an expiration date.

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, continued uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed under the headings “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Risk Factors” could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

Operating activities reflects net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include gains, losses, impairment charges, other charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.

The decrease in cash from operating activities reflected higher merchandise purchases and payments of accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, as well as lower net income, as compared with the same period last year. Higher merchandise purchases were necessary as our year-end inventory levels were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated supply chain challenges.

As of July 30, 2022, we have withheld approximately $7 million of lease and lease-related payments as we continue to negotiate rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

[TABLE_END]

The change in investing activities primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, partially offset by divestiture of certain assets.

For the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, capital expenditures increased by $69 million to $156 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Our full-year capital spending is expected to be $275 million. The forecast includes $191 million related to the remodeling or relocation of approximately 140 existing stores and the opening of approximately 110 new stores, as well as $84 million for the development of information systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives.

During the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, we paid an additional $12 million for the WSS and atmos acquisitions upon the satisfaction of certain post-closing conditions.

We have invested $4 million in minority investments during the current year, including various limited partner venture capital funds managed by Black fund managers, who are committed to advancing diverse-led businesses as part of our Leading in Education and Economic Development (LEED) initiative. During the second quarter of 2022, we sold our position in one of our minority investments receiving proceeds of $12 million. In the prior-year period, we invested $68 million in a public entity, Retailors Ltd., and $10 million in minority investments primarily related to LEED.

Also during the second quarter of 2022, we sold our Eastbay Team Sales business receiving proceeds of $47 million and resulting in a gain of $18 million.

We sold the former Runners Point headquarters in the first quarter of 2021, generating proceeds of $3 million. Also last year, we received insurance proceeds of $3 million related to property and equipment claims from the social unrest losses in 2020.
