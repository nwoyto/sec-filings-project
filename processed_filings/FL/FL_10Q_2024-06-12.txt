CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

​

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these particular words.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and other plans and objectives for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained herein are largely based on our expectations for the future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends, and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate.

We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including access to premium products, volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or the ability to cancel orders or return merchandise; inventory management; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; execution of the Company's long-term strategic plan; a recession, volatility in the financial markets, and other global economic factors, including inflation; capital and resource allocation among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; cash management; liquidity; cash flow from operations; access to credit markets at competitive terms; borrowing capacity under our credit facility; cash repatriation; supply chain issues; labor shortages and wage pressures; consumer spending levels; licensed store arrangements; the effect of certain governmental assistance programs; the success of our marketing and sponsorship arrangements; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the effect of increased government regulation, compliance, and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation or government investigation that affects us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; ESG risks; increased competition; geopolitical events; the financial effects of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; counterparty risks; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance.

Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investment in our securities. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this report, or any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Foot Locker, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), is a leading footwear and apparel retailer. We have integrated all available shopping channels, including stores, websites, apps, and social channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our distribution centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on availability of particular items. We operate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, representing our operating segments. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year. Additionally, the results of operations for the period ended May 4, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may affect us for the remainder of the year.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2023 Form 10 -K.

There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Form 10 -K.

There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets and liabilities for any of the periods presented.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were as follows:

[TABLE_START]
May 4, | April 29, | ($ in millions) | 2024 | 2023 | Carrying value | (1) | $ | 395 | $ | 395 | Fair value | $ | 321 | $ | 339

9. Earnings Per Share

We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS. The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | May 4, | April 29, | (in millions, except per share data) | 2024 | 2023 | Net income | $ | 8 | $ | 36 | Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 94.7 | 93.7 | Dilutive effect of potential common shares | 0.6 | 1.4 | Weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution | 95.3 | 95.1 | ​ | ​ | ​ | Earnings per share - basic | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.39 | Earnings per share - diluted | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.38 | ​ | ​ | ​ | Anti-dilutive share-based awards excluded from diluted calculation | 2.6 | 2.3
[TABLE_END]

Performance stock units related to our long-term incentive programs of 1.8 million and 0.9 million have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares for the periods ended May 4, 2024 and April 29, 2023 , respectively. The issuance of these shares is contingent on our performance metrics as compared to the pre-established performance goals, which have not been achieved.

10. Pension

The components of net periodic pension benefit expense are presented in the table below. Service cost is recognized as part of SG&A expense, while the other components are recognized as part of Other (expense) income, net.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Restricted stock units (“RSU”) are awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and nonemployee directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to certain officers and key employees in connection with our long-term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock, provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied. PSU awards also include a performance objective based on our relative total shareholder return over the performance period to a pre-determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The fair value of the market condition of our PSU awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant.

Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically over three years for employees and one year for nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to the terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the relevant performance period. PSUs granted in 2024 vest after the attainment of the performance period, which is three years. Prior PSU grants vested after the attainment of the performance period and an additional one -year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting peri od on a straight-line basis.

RSU and PSU activity for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 is summarized as follows:

​

[TABLE_START]
​ | ​ | Weighted- | Average | Weighted- | ​ | Number | Remaining | Average | ​ | of | Contractual | Grant Date | ​ | Shares | Life | Fair Value | ​ | (in thousands) | (in years) | (per share) | Nonvested at beginning of year | 1,378 | ​ | $ | 38.81 | Granted | 1,346 | ​ | 29.16 | Vested | ( | 417 | ) | ​ | 52.23 | Forfeited | ( | 10 | ) | ​ | 37.66 | Nonvested at May 4, 2024 | 2,297 | 1.9 | $ | 30.72 | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Aggregate value ($ in millions) | $ | 71 | ​
[TABLE_END]

The total value of RSU and PSU awards that vested during the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 and April 29, 2023 was $ 22 million and $ 21 million, respectively. As of May 4, 2024 , there was $ 30 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards.

12. Legal Proceedings

Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, or pre-litigation demands, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims.

We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could adversely affect the Company's operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

Item 2. Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Foot Locker, Inc. is a leading footwear and apparel retailer that unlocks the "inner sneakerhead" in all of us. We have a strong history of sneaker authority that sparks discovery and ignites the power of sneaker culture through our portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and atmos.

Ensuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our websites, or on our mobile applications, is a high priority for us. We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners. These sites offer our largest product selections and provide a seamless link between our e-commerce experience and physical stores.

Store Count

At May 4, 2024, we operated 2,490 stores as compared with 2,523 and 2,692 stores at February 3, 2024 and April 29, 2023, respectively.

Licensed Operations

A total of 206 licensed stores were operating at May 4, 2024, as compared with 202 and 163 stores at February 3, 2024 and April 29, 2023, respectively, operating in the Middle East and Asia. These stores are not included in the operating store count above.

Results of Operations

We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

The table below summarizes our results for the period.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.

These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in allowing a more direct comparison of our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.

The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition, and not as an alternative, to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP.

Segment Reporting and Results of Operations

We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Kids Foot Locker, and WSS, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as atmos, which operates in Japan. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Sales

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. In fiscal years following those with 53 weeks, including 2024, we calculate comparable sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior-year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.

For the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, total sales decreased by $53 million, or 2.8%, to $1,874 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased by $46.0 million, or 2.4%, for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024. The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel.

[TABLE_END]

Comparable sales decreased by 1.8% as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. By operating segment, North America and Asia Pacific decreased by 2.5% and 5.5% , respectively, while EMEA generated an increase of 1.6% . Comparable sales decreased in our stores channel in 2024, due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds as our customers became more discerning due to inflation and other cost pressures, which affected customer traffic and conversion, as well as the continued repositioning of our Champs Sports banner. As previously announced, we are repositioning the Champs Sports banner to serve the active athlete, which resulted in expected comparable sales declines due to the transition. The decrease in comparable sales in the stores channel was partially offset by an increase in the direct-to-consumer channel.

For the combined channels, sales excluding foreign currency fluctuations, declined in North America and Asia Pacific, but remained essentially unchanged in EMEA. North America sales were negatively affected by the repositioning of Champs Sports. Additionally WSS' sales benefited from its new store growth, period-over-period they operated 21 additional stores. Constant currency sales for EMEA were unchanged, reflecting an increase in sales from our Foot Locker stores, offset by the loss of sales from the Sidestep banner. We exited the Sidestep business late into the second quarter of 2023. Asia Pacific's sales, excluding foreign currency fluctuations, decreased primarily as a result of the closure of our operations in Hong Kong and Macau and the sale of our Singapore and Malaysia operations to our licensing partner in the second quarter of 2023. Within Asia Pacific, sales, excluding foreign currency fluctuations, decreased in Australia and New Zealand due to a highly competitive marketplace, which was partially offset by an increase in sales from our business operating in South Korea. The decline in sales from atmos was predominantly due to the closing of its U.S. operations, which ceased operations at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. On a comparable sales basis, atmos' sales increased as a result of the availability of key styles and a rise in traffic from tourism to Japan.

From a product perspective for the combined channels, comparable sales declined in apparel and accessories, partially offset by gains in the footwear category, led by our array of strategic and emerging brand partners .

Gross Margin

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | May 4, | April 29, | ​ | 2024 | 2023 | Gross margin rate | 28.8 | % | 30.0 | % | Basis point decrease in the gross margin rate | (120 | ) | ​ | Components of the change: | ​ | Merchandise margin rate decline | (140 | ) | ​ | Lower occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense rate | 20 | ​
[TABLE_END]

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

First Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q Page 18

[PAGE BREAK]

Table of Contents

The gross margin rate decreased to 28.8% for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 140-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and a 20-basis point leverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate. The decline in merchandise margin rate reflected higher promotional activity in the current marketplace. The leverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate was primarily related to rent renegotiations and our focus on profitability in the store portfolio.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)

[TABLE_START]

[TABLE_END]

Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A increased by $32 million for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 220 basis points for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, primarily due to investments in technology and brand-building as well as higher inflation, partially offset by savings from the cost optimization program, store closures, and ongoing expense discipline.

[TABLE_END]

Depreciation and amortization expense remained flat for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Despite the higher capital expenditures during the quarter, due to the timing, the effect of our capital spending was offset by operating fewer stores and lower depreciation and amortization associated with prior impairment charges.

Impairment and Other

For the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, we recorded a $7 million loss accrual for legal claims and a $7 million impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets related to our decision to no longer operate, and to sublease, one of our larger unprofitable stores in Europe. In the corresponding prior-year period, we recorded impairment charges of $19 million related to transformation consulting expense, $18 million of impairment charges related to accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for the closures of the Sidestep banner and certain Foot Locker Asia stores, and $2 million of reorganization costs related to the closure of a North American Distribution center and costs associated with the closure of the Sidestep banner and certain Foot Locker Asia stores.

Corporate expense increased by $7 million for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $9 million for each of the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 and April 29, 2023. Corporate expense increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation tied to performance and our ongoing investments in information technology.

[TABLE_END]

Division profit margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 2.3% for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, driven by the declines in sales and gross margins and deleveraging expenses.

[TABLE_END]

Interest expense, net for the quarter-to-date period remained flat for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior-year period, however it reflected an increase in interest expense, offset by higher interest income primarily due to higher rates on our invested cash and cash and equivalents.

This caption includes non-operating items, including changes in fair value of minority investments measured at fair value or using the fair value measurement alternative, changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security, our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investments, and net benefit / (expense) related to our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component.

For the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, other (expense) income, net reflected expense of $2 million related to our pension and postretirement programs and a $2 million loss on our equity method investments. The corresponding prior-year period reflected expense of $2 million related to our pension and postretirement programs, and a $1 million loss on our equity method investments.

Income Taxes

[TABLE_END]

Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate, which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented.

We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. During the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 and April 29, 2023, we recognized $2 million and $4 million, respectively, reserve releases from various statute of limitations expirations on our foreign income taxes.

During the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 , we recorded $2 million of expense related to tax deficiencies from share-based compensation, primarily from the vesting of certain grants. The amount recorded in the corresponding prior-year period was not significant.

Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the current year period increased, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to the lower-level income before tax with non-deductible expenses remaining relatively unchanged, coupled with a change in geographic mix of earnings.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax of 15%. Based on current enacted legislation effective in 2024 and our structure, the effect of these rules were not significant to our overall effective tax rate for thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024 and we do not currently expect a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate for 2024. We are monitoring developments and evaluating the effects that these new rules will have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition, and results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements .

The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of May 4, 2024, approximately $1,103 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program.

Our expected full-year capital spending is $290 million and an additional $55 million is expected related to software-as-a-service implementation costs, totaling spend of $345 million. The forecast includes $200 million related to the updating ("refresh"), remodeling or relocation of stores, as well as new stores. Updating our stores or "refreshes" represent spending directed towards elevating our brand experience, with modest capital expenditures per store. Additionally, we expect to spend $90 million primarily for our technology and supply chain initiatives, including capital expenditures related to two new distribution centers. We also expect to spend an additional $55 million in software-as-a-service implementation costs, related to our technology initiatives as we modernize our enterprise resource planning tools including e-commerce, supply chain, and finance. We have the ability to revise and reschedule some of the anticipated spending program should our financial position require it.

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the headings “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Risk Factors” could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

Operating Activities

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | May 4, | April 29, | ($ in millions) | 2024 | 2023 | Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | $ | 58 | $ | (118 | ) | $ Change | $ | 176 | ​
[TABLE_END]

Operating activities reflects net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include impairment charges, other charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.

The increase in cash from operating activities as compared with the same period last year reflected the changes in working capital, including the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, partially offset by lower net income.

Investing Activities

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | May 4, | April 29, | ($ in millions) | 2024 | 2023 | Net cash used in investing activities | $ | (76 | ) | $ | (59 | ) | $ Change | $ | (17 | ) | ​
[TABLE_END]

The change in investing activities reflected higher capital expenditures in the current period. For the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, capital expenditures increased by $17 million to $76 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Our current year capital plans call for the updating of approximately 440 existing stores to our current design standards.  During the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, we remodeled or relocated 29 stores, including the updating of 13 stores to new design standards.

Financing Activities

[TABLE_START]
​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | May 4, | April 29, | ($ in millions) | 2024 | 2023 | Net cash used in financing activities | $ | (1 | ) | $ | (46 | ) | $ Change | $ | 45 | ​
[TABLE_END]

The change in financing activities primarily resulted from our decision not to pay dividends during the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2024, as compared with $38 million in dividends paid in the corresponding prior-year period. Also contributing to the decrease was a $6 million reduction in payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to vesting of share-based equity awards.

Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)

In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.
