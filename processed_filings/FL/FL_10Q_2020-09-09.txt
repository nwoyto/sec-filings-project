CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

​

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” These statements include statements relating to trends in or expectations relating to the expected effects of our initiatives, strategies and plans, as well as trends in or expectations regarding our financial results and long-term growth model and drivers, tax rates, business opportunities and expansion, strategic acquisitions or investments, expenses, dividends, share repurchases, and our mitigation strategies, liquidity, cash flow from operations, use of cash and cash requirements, investments, borrowing capacity and use of proceeds, repatriation of cash to the U.S., and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and recent social unrest on our financial results. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. These forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are unforeseeable and beyond our control, such as the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance.

​

Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and “Item 1A Risk Factors” included in this Form 10-Q. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this report or any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. As used in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) the terms “Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year. The results of operations for the periods ended August 1, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may affect us for the remainder of 2020. Specifically, we are uncertain of the extent to which the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic will affect our sales, traffic to our stores, including our distribution capabilities and those of our suppliers.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Foot Locker, Inc.’s Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 27, 2020.

Other than the changes to the Goodwill policies as a result of the recently adopted accounting standards discussed below, there were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2020.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On February 2, 2020, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is considered to be a service contract, that requires companies to follow the guidance for internal-use software to determine which costs to capitalize in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. Under this guidance, such implementation costs will be capitalized in Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the related amortization presented in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. This guidance was applied prospectively to implementation costs incurred after February 2, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

On February 2, 2020, we adopted FASB’s updated guidance on the accounting for performing goodwill impairment tests. This update eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. In testing goodwill for impairment, an entity may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Refer to our updated accounting policy in Note 6, Goodwill.

Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

Contract Liabilities

We sell gift cards which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift cards are redeemed by customers. Breakage income is recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer . The table below presents the activity of our gift card liability balance:

We elected not to disclose the information about remaining performance obligations since the amount of gift cards redeemed after 12 months is not significant.

3. Segment Information

We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, social channels, and catalogs. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory but may also be shipped from any of our distribution centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on the availability of particular items.

We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is the banner’s financial results referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest (expense) income. The following table summarizes our results:

​

We recorded charges of $ 18 million related to social unrest in the second quarter, which resulted in physical damage and inventory loss to approximately 135 stores. This charge included inventory losses of $ 14 million, damages to store property of $ 2 million, and repairs and other costs of $ 2 million. We are currently working with our insurers to determine the amount of our covered losses under our property insurance policy. Insurance recovery for losses in excess of our deductible will be recorded in the period in which we conclude our settlement discussions with our insurance providers.

​

In May 2020, we made the strategic decision to shut down our Runners Point business and to consolidate our Sidestep support staff into our other operations in Europe. Also, as part of the next phase of the Champs Sports and Eastbay strategic initiative, we restructured positions and aligned several functions across the banners and plan to consolidate certain Eastbay operations from Wausau, Wisconsin into the Champs Sports headquarters in Bradenton, Florida. We recorded charges of $ 16 million related to the shutdown of the Runners Point business and $ 3 million related to the reorganization associated with Eastbay.

​

As part of the decision to close the Runners Point banner, certain Runners Point stores will convert to other banners and approximately 40 Runners Point and Sidestep stores will close prior to their natural lease expiration. The following table presents a rollforward of our restructuring liability, which is recorded in Accrued and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining restructuring liability at August 1, 2020, which primarily relates to severance payments, is expected to be substantially paid within the next twelve months.

[TABLE_END]

​

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our actual and projected results, during the first quarter of 2020 we determined that a triggering event occurred for certain underperforming stores operating in Europe and, therefore, we conducted an impairment review. We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets, of 70 stores and recorded non-cash charges of $ 15 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets.

The Company and its U.S. pension plan were involved in litigation related to the conversion of the plan to a cash balance plan. The court entered its final judgment in 2018, which required the plan to be reformed as directed by the court order. We recorded charges of $ 2 million for both the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019 related to administrative expenses in connection with the reformation. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019, we incurred $ 13 million of lease termination costs related to the closure of our SIX:02 locations.

5. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

6. Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The review of impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test.

In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in our stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of the Company and macroeconomic conditions affecting retail. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).

We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units.

In addition to performing our qualitative assessment of as the beginning of the year, we performed an additional quantitative assessment during the first quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our results and stock price. Neither assessment resulted in the recognition of impairment.

7. Other Intangible Assets, net

8. Revolving Credit Facility

In the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $ 330 million under our revolving credit facility. During the second quarter of 2020, we repaid the amount borrowed. On July 14, 2020 , we amended to our credit agreement with the banks (as amended, “2020 Credit Agreement”). The 2020 Credit Agreement now provides for a $ 600 million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on July 14, 2025 .

​

At our option, interest is determined by either (1) the eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent per annum, or (2) the base rate, determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent, in each case, depending on availability under the 2020 Credit Agreement. In addition, we are paying a commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the 2020 Credit Agreement.

​

If certain specified events of default have occurred and are continuing, or if availability under the 2020 Credit Agreement is less than or equal to the greater of $ 60 million and 10 percent of the Loan Cap (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement), we are required to test compliance with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter.

11. Fair Value Measurements

Our financial assets are recorded at fair value, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are categorized as follows:

[TABLE_START]
Level 1 | – | Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
[TABLE_END]

[TABLE_START]
Level 2 – | Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
[TABLE_END]

[TABLE_START]
Level 3 – | Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.
[TABLE_END]

The fair value of the auction rate security, classified as available-for-sale, is determined by using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.

​

Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility and therefore are classified as Level 2 instruments.

[TABLE_END]

​

There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets and liabilities for any of the periods presented.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These assets are measured using Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired.

Minority interests measured using the fair value measurement alternative had a carrying value of $ 137 million, $ 133 million, and $ 137 million as of August 1, 2020, August 3, 2019, and February 1, 2020, respectively, and are included within Other assets. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash charge of $ 7 million related to the write-down of such minority investments.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were as follows:

[TABLE_START]
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ($ in millions) | August 1, 2020 | August 3, 2019 | February 1, 2020 | Carrying value | ​ | $ | 121 | ​ | $ | 123 | ​ | $ | 122 | Fair value | ​ | $ | 129 | ​ | $ | 136 | ​ | $ | 135
[TABLE_END]

​

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and other current receivables and payables approximate their fair value.

12. Earnings Per Share

We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS.

The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

​

Restricted stock units related to our long-term incentive programs of 0.5 million and 0.7 million have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares for the periods ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019, respectively. The issuance of these shares are contingent on our performance metrics as compared to the pre-established performance goals, which have not been achieved.

13. Pension

We have a defined benefit pension plan covering certain of our North American employees.

The components of net periodic pension benefit cost are presented in the table below. Service cost is recognized as part of SG&A expense, while the other components are recognized as part of Other income, net.

Valuation Model and Assumptions

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various and subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units (“RSU”) may be awarded to certain officers and key employees of the Company. Additionally, RSU awards are made to employees in connection with our long-term incentive program, and to nonemployee directors. Each RSU award represents the right to receive one share of our common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied.

​

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

​

Generally, awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years. However, RSU awards made in connection with our performance-based long-term incentive program are earned after the attainment of certain performance metrics and, with regards to certain awards, vest after an additional one-year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on any RSU awards.

Compensation expense is recognized using the market value at the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period, provided the recipient continues to be employed by the Company.

RSU activity for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 is summarized as follows:

​

15. Income Taxes

For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $ 25 million and $ 30 million, respectively, and represented an effective tax rate of 35.4 percent and negative 85.5 percent on a pretax income and pretax loss, respectively. The effective tax rates were adversely impacted by valuation allowances related to losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, in the first quarter we recorded a $ 27 million tax charge related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property rights pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement. Due to the improved financial outlook during the second quarter of 2020, we reversed $ 2 million of the revaluation charge.

​

We have historically calculated the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year income, excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items, for the reporting period. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate income taxes for the first quarter of 2020 because small changes in the estimated level and mix of annual income or loss by jurisdiction would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate making the historical method unreliable. However, during the second quarter we returned to the historical practice of using an annual effective rate.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

​

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, governments around the world enacted or implemented various forms of tax relief measures in response to the economic conditions in the wake of COVID-19. We are required to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment. We have assessed the applicability of the CARES Act and changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions and determined there is no significant affect to our income tax provision for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020. We continue to assess the effect of the CARES Act and ongoing government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued.

16. Legal Proceedings

​

Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims.

We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

​

17. Subsequent Events

​

During the first quarter, we suspended our second quarter dividend as a result of the economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 20, 2020 , our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our quarterly dividend program at a rate of $ 0.15 per share, which will be payable on October 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on October 16, 2020 . The Board will continue to evaluate the dividend program on a quarterly basis.

​

One of our minority investments, which is measured using the fair value measurement alternative, received additional funding in August at a higher valuation than our initial investment. This transaction is expected to generate a significant non-cash gain during the third quarter.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Foot Locker, Inc. leads the celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe through a portfolio of banners including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Eastbay, Footaction, Runners Point, and Sidestep. Foot Locker, Inc. and its subsidiaries hereafter are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us.” We operate primarily mall-based stores, as well as stores in high-traffic urban retail areas and high streets, in 27 countries including the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. Our purpose is to inspire and empower youth culture around the world, by fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled experiences at the heart of the global sneaker community.

We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the names of our store banners (including footlocker.com, ladyfootlocker.com, kidsfootlocker.com, champssports.com, footaction.com, footlocker.ca, footlocker.eu (and related e-commerce sites in the various European countries that we operate), footlocker.com.au, runnerspoint.com, sidestep-shoes.com, footlocker.hk, footlocker.sg, and footlocker.my). These sites offer some of the largest online product selections and provide a seamless link between e-commerce and physical stores. We also operate the websites for eastbay.com, final-score.com, and eastbayteamsales.com.

Store Count

At August 1, 2020, we operated 3,100 stores as compared with 3,129 and 3,174 stores at February 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019, respectively.

Franchise Operations

A total of 138 franchised stores were operating at August 1, 2020, as compared with 139 and 133 stores at February 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019, respectively. Revenue from franchised stores was not significant for any of the periods presented. These stores are not included in the operating store count above.

COVID-19 Update

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 is having a significant effect on overall economic conditions in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns. In March, we closed all our stores in North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and most of Asia Pacific. We also transitioned to a work-from-home environment for all our office team members and temporarily closed certain of our distribution centers. Our stores remained closed for a significant portion of the first quarter, however we adjusted our openings in accordance with local government guidelines and operated for approximately 70 percent of the operating days during the second quarter.

​

We have set up a special COVID-19 management committee and the committee is taking the necessary precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our team members, as well as following the guidance provided by local health authorities. We have been highly focused on the changes we are making to operate more safely in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented newly-established health protocols, including providing personal protective equipment to our team members and implementing social distancing work- practices. Prior to reopening our stores, we implemented various protocols including: occupancy limits, installing protective shields at the registers, encouraging social distancing, providing markers in our queue lines, implementing new processes for handling merchandise returns, and instituting new cleaning regimens, including enhanced cleaning of high-touch surfaces throughout the day.

Second Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q Page 19

[PAGE BREAK]

​

We have taken numerous steps to protect the health and well-being of our team members, customers, and communities, while also focusing on further strengthening our financial liquidity and flexibility. On April 21, 2020, we communicated to our United States, Canadian, and Australian employees that we were temporarily furloughing (or its equivalent under applicable local law) the majority of our hourly store and certain of our hourly distribution centers team members. We continued to pay all active employees through the week ended April 26, 2020. All team members were called back to work during the second quarter, except in California where we have temporarily closed all mall-based stores across all of our banners at the direction of the state government. Additionally, other measures to preserve our financial position were taken, such as temporarily reducing executive salaries, temporarily suspending the cash element of director compensation, temporarily suspending share repurchases and dividends, and by significantly reducing planned capital expenditures. In July 2020, we amended our credit facility and increased it to $600 million with a 5-year maturity. Due to the positive performance of the Company’s business, strong liquidity position, and more stable cash outlook, these measures were reversed during the third quarter.

​

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted into law and provided opportunities for additional liquidity, emergency assistance for individuals, families and businesses affected by COVID-19. During the first quarter, we recognized benefits from the CARES Act, including federal retention tax credits of up to $5,000 per employee for the wages and health insurance we continued to provide to team members not providing services, a deferral of employer social security taxes for the remainder of 2020, 50 percent of which is payable by December 2021 and the remainder payable by December 2022. Additionally, various jurisdictions in which we operate implemented similar legislation to encourage the continued employment of team members. We intend to continue to review and consider any available potential benefits under the CARES Act or other governmental support for which we qualify. During the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we recognized benefits of $57 million from the various governmental support programs. We also deferred $12 million of U.S. employer social security taxes through August 1, 2020.

Additionally, the CARES Act contains several significant income tax provisions, including a temporary five-year carryback of net operating losses and relaxed restrictions on business interest deductions, as well as a permanent technical correction to the depreciation method applicable to “qualified improvement property” placed in service after 2017. We are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. We have assessed the applicability of this legislation on our income tax provision and determined there is no significant effect to our 2020 income tax provision.

The continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak may cause prolonged or additional intermittent periods of store closures, modified operating schedules, and may result in changes in customer behaviors, including a potential reduction in consumer discretionary spending in our stores. We are experiencing an increase in operating costs for health and safety protocols for both our team members and customers and increased freight costs. Due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our results may be further negatively affected and may lead to increased asset recovery and valuation risks, such as long-lived tangible and right-of-use asset impairments and an inability to realize deferred tax assets due to sustaining losses in certain jurisdictions. The uncertainties in the global economy will likely affect the financial viability of some number of our vendors and may require other changes to our operations. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption, and reduced customer traffic in our stores, the related financial affect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but are expected to materially affect our business for the remainder of 2020. Due to these unprecedented conditions, we have withdrawn our financial guidance for 2020.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

Second Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q Page 20

[PAGE BREAK]

​

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.

These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period. The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019.

​

During the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $38 million and $54 million, respectively, classified as Impairment and Other Charges. This compares with charges of $14 million and $15 million recognized for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019, respectively.  See the Impairment and Other Charges section for further information.

Related to the non-GAAP adjustments for income taxes, during the first quarter of 2020 we recorded a $27 million tax charge related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property rights, pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement. Due to the improved financial outlook during the second quarter of 2020, we reversed $2 million of the revaluation charge. In connection with U.S. tax reform, we recorded a charge for $2 million for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2019. The charge reflected an adjustment to U.S. tax on foreign income.

Segment Reporting

We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and Footaction, including each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business that includes internet, catalog, and team sales. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Runners Point, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker and the related e-commerce businesses, as applicable, operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Results of Operations

We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is the banner’s financial results referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expenses, non-operating income, and net interest (expense) income. The following table summarizes our results:

Sales

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Stores that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic are also included in the computation of comparable-store sales. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel:

[TABLE_START]
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | ​ | ​ | August 1, | August 3, | August 1, | August 1, | ($ in millions) | ​ | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 | Stores | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Sales | ​ | $ | 1,388 | ​ | $ | 1,521 | ​ | $ | 2,202 | ​ | $ | 3,279 | ​ | $ Change | ​ | $ | (133) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | $ | (1,077) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | % Change | ​ | ​ | (8.7) | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | (32.9) | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | % of total sales | ​ | ​ | 66.8 | % | ​ | 85.7 | % | ​ | 67.7 | % | ​ | 85.1 | % | Comparable sales (decrease) increase | ​ | ​ | (7.6) | % | ​ | (0.1) | % | ​ | (32.1) | % | ​ | 1.5 | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Direct-to-customers | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Sales | ​ | $ | 689 | ​ | ​ | 253 | ​ | $ | 1,051 | ​ | $ | 573 | ​ | $ Change | ​ | $ | 436 | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | $ | 478 | ​ | $ | ​ | ​ | % Change | ​ | ​ | 172.3 | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | 83.4 | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | % of total sales | ​ | ​ | 33.2 | % | ​ | 14.3 | % | ​ | 32.3 | % | ​ | 14.9 | % | Comparable sales increase | ​ | ​ | 172.8 | % | ​ | 6.5 | % | ​ | 84.3 | % | ​ | 10.9 | %
[TABLE_END]

For the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020, total sales increased by $303 million, or 17.1 percent, to $2,077 million, compared with the comparable period ended August 3, 2019. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, total sales decreased by $599 million, or 15.6 percent, to $3,253 million, as compared with the comparable period of the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales increased by $308 million, or 17.3 percent, for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020 and decreased by $583 million, or 15.1 percent, for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020.

Total comparable sales increased by 18.6 percent for the thirteen weeks ending August 1, 2020 and decreased by 14.5 percent for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, as compared with the comparable prior-year periods. For both periods, our direct-to-customers channel generated significant increases and was offset by sales declines in the stores channel. Our previous investments in our omnichannel ecosystem, including supply chain capabilities, have been instrumental  in delivering a seamless customer experience resulting in our digital business representing approximately a third of our sales for both the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2020. Our investments allowed us to leverage our direct-to-customers business to continue to serve our customers achieving peak daily volume levels. Pent-up demand for classic basketball styles and key launch footwear, coupled with governmental stimulus payments, positively affected our sales during the second quarter. For the year-to-date period, the overall decrease in sales was a result of the temporary closure of our stores across all of our banners around the world beginning in mid-March, as well as reduced store traffic upon reopening due to the ongoing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the combined channels, our operating segments in North America and Asia Pacific generated positive sales, while EMEA declined for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020. In  North America, all banners and Eastbay generated positive comparable sales increases. Sales were led by Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Footaction, and Kids Foot Locker. The sales increases in Asia Pacific was led by sales in Australia and New Zealand. In EMEA, our customers were more conservative coming out of the stay at home orders and coupled with the fact that our customer’s acceptance of digital shopping is not as strong, resulted in an overall decline in sales.

Second Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q Page 23

[PAGE BREAK]

​

Both our North American and EMEA operating segments had significant declines in the stores channel for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, due to the temporary closures beginning in mid-March related to the pandemic, while Asia Pacific was slightly positive.

Sales of footwear and apparel increased for thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, while sales of accessories declined primarily from decreased sales of back packs due to the uncertainties around the return to school since some jurisdictions are opting for remote learning. All wearer segments within the footwear category experienced increases, which was primarily related to lower sales of men’s and children’s basketball footwear styles. Our women's footwear business reflected the ongoing popularity of classic basketball and court styles. Apparel sales benefited from the athleisure trend with increased demand for comfortable clothing.

For the year-to-date period, we experienced a decline across all product categories and wearer segments primarily due to closures necessitated by the pandemic.

Gross Margin

[TABLE_START]
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | ​ | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | ​ | ​ | August 1, | ​ | August 3, | ​ | ​ | August 1, | ​ | August 3, | ​ | ​ | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 | Gross margin rate | 25.9 | % | 30.1 | % | 24.9 | % | 31.7 | % | Basis point decrease in the gross margin rate | (420) | ​ | (680) | ​ | Components of the change- | ​ | ​ | Merchandise margin rate decline | (700) | (20) | (510) | (40) | Lower/(Higher) occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense rate | 280 | 10 | (170) | 40
[TABLE_END]

​

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

The gross margin rate decreased for both the thirteen weeks and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, as compared with corresponding prior-year periods. The decline in the gross margin rate was due to increased promotions to remain competitive in the marketplace and to clear inventory to ensure we maintained a healthy inventory position, as well as the higher portion of direct-to-customer sales, which bear higher freight costs. Offsetting, in part, the higher promotional markdowns taken was increased vendor support, which positively affected both the second quarter and year-to-date gross margin rate by 90 basis points as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods.

The occupancy rate for the second quarter and the year-to-date period was positively affected by the increase in direct-to-customer sales. Additionally, due to lease negotiations we were able to record $6 million of rent savings due to rent abatements during the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020. The occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense rate deleveraged for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 due primarily to temporary store closures in the first quarter. Although we withheld rent payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actively negotiating rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed. However, only a portion of the abatements is reflected in the rent expense as not all the negotiations are completed.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)

[TABLE_START]
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Thirteen weeks ended | ​ | ​ | Twenty-six weeks ended | ​ | ​ | ​ | August 1, | ​ | August 3, | ​ | ​ | August 1, | ​ | August 3, | ($ in millions) | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 | SG&A | ​ | $ | 387 | ​ | $ | 393 | ​ | ​ | $ | 703 | ​ | $ | 809 | ​ | $ Change | ​ | $ | (6) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | $ | (106) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | % Change | ​ | (1.5) | % | ​ | ​ | ​ | (13.1) | % | ​ | ​ | SG&A as a percentage of sales | ​ | 18.6 | % | 22.2 | % | ​ | 21.6 | % | 21.0 | %
[TABLE_END]

​

SG&A decreased by $6 million and $106 million for the thirteen weeks and the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A decreased by $6 million and $102 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods.

As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 18.6 percent for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020. The lower percentage is due to strong sales in the second quarter, as well as CARES Act retention credits of $17 million, partially offset by $6 million incurred for personal protective equipment and higher incentive compensation expense. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, SG&A, as a percentage of sales,  increased to 21.6 percent. The SG&A rate reflected significantly lower sales as a result of temporary store closures during the first quarter in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by CARES Act retention credits of $57 million as we continued to pay our employees throughout most of the first quarter despite the temporary store closures. We carefully managed expenses by reducing spending in all areas of the business, including marketing and travel, among other categories.

Corporate expense (a component of SG&A) decreased for both the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 which reflected a change in allocation of expense. Annually the allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions is adjusted based upon an internal study. The allocation reduced corporate expense by $7 million and $15 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively. Excluding the change in allocation, the increase in corporate expense was related primarily to increased incentive compensation expense.

​

Depreciation and Amortization

[TABLE_END]

​

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2 million for both the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization decreased $3 million and $2 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods.

​

We recorded charges of $18 million related to social unrest in the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in physical damage and inventory loss to approximately 135 stores. This charge included inventory losses of $14 million, damages to store property of $2 million, and repairs and other costs of $2 million. We are currently working with our insurers to determine the amount of our covered losses under our property insurance policy. Insurance recovery for losses in excess of our deductible will be recorded in the period in which we conclude our settlement discussions with our insurance providers.

​

In May 2020, we made the strategic decision to shut down our Runners Point business and to consolidate our Sidestep support staff into our other operations in Europe. Also, as part of the next phase of the Champs Sports and Eastbay strategic initiative, we restructured positions and aligned several functions across the banners and plan to consolidate certain Eastbay operations into Champs Sports. We recorded charges of $16 million related to the shutdown of the Runners Point business and $3 million related to the reorganization associated with Eastbay.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our actual and projected results, during the first quarter of 2020 we determined that a triggering event occurred for certain underperforming stores operating in Europe and, therefore, we conducted an impairment review. We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets, of 70 stores and recorded non-cash charges of $15 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets.

The Company and its U.S. pension plan were involved in litigation related to the conversion of the plan to a cash balance plan. The court entered its final judgment in 2018, which required the plan to be reformed as directed by the court order. Administrative expenses in connection with the reformation were $1 million for both the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019 and were $2 million for both the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019.

For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019, we incurred $13 million of lease termination costs related to the closure of our SIX:02 locations.

[TABLE_END]

​

Division profit margin decreased to 6.0 percent and 1.4 percent for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date period, division profit reflected a significant increase in the direct-to-customers sales channel, offset by a decline in the stores channel. For the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020, lower gross margin decreased division profit compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, lower sales due to the temporary store closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with lower gross margin and higher SG&A, as a percentage of sales, decreased the results compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Management is continuing to monitor the results of each of the banners as the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and assumptions around the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to perform an impairment analysis over certain store long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets in future quarters.

We recorded $2 million and $3 million of net interest expense for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, respectively, as compared with net interest income of $2 million and $6 million for the corresponding prior-year periods. Interest expense increased due to the drawdown of the revolving credit facility in March 2020. Additionally, interest income decreased primarily as a result of lower average interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents.

​

We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. The changes in the tax reserves were not significant for any of the periods presented.

The effective tax rates for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 were adversely affected by valuation allowances related to losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, the tax rate was negatively affected by a tax charge related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property rights pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement. During the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020, due to an improved financial outlook, we reduced the $27 million tax charge recognized in the first quarter of 2020 by $2 million. During the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we recognized a $2 million tax benefit for the reversal of a withholding tax accrual that is no longer required.

​

For the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2019, the Company recorded a tax expense of $2 million for an adjustment to US tax on foreign income attributable to 2017 U.S. tax reform. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $3 million due to an adjustment to a foreign tax credit valuation allowance.

​

Excluding the above-mentioned discrete items, the effective tax rates for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 increased, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods, primarily due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and losses.

​

We expect the full-year tax rate to be elevated relative to historical levels due to the geographic mix of income and losses, as well as the limits to tax benefits for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.

​

Net Income

For the thirteen-weeks ended August 1, 2020, we reported net income of $45 million, as compared to net income of $60 million in the corresponding prior-year period. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we reported a net loss of $65 million as compared to net income of $232 million in the corresponding prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 21.8 percent to $0.43 per share for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2020 compared with $0.55 in the thirteen-weeks ended August 3, 2019.

Diluted loss per share was $0.62 for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 as compared with diluted earnings per share of $2.08 for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity continues to be cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash are to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We also from time to time may make investments in other companies that we believe support our vision of inspiring and empowering youth culture. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and future cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund these requirements.

The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

During the first and second quarters of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in an effort to conserve cash, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. As of August 1, 2020, $867 million remained available under the current 3-year share repurchase program. Also, after thoughtful consideration by our Board of Directors, we suspended our second quarter dividend distribution to preserve our balance sheet strength and flexibility. On August 20, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our quarterly dividend program at a rate of $0.15 per share, which will be payable on October 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on October 16, 2020. The Board will continue to evaluate the dividend program on a quarterly basis. Additionally, our Board of Directors removed the suspension related to share repurchases effective September 1, 2020.

​

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key vendors for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed under the headings “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Risk Factors” could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

[TABLE_END]

​

Operating activities reflects net (loss) income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net (loss) income for non-cash items include impairment charges, other charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities, as compared with the same period last year, reflected higher accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net income.

As of August 1, 2020, we have withheld approximately $87 million of lease and lease related payments as we continue to negotiate rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019, we contributed $55 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan primarily representing the funds available in the qualified settlement fund established in connection with the pension matter.

​

For the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, capital expenditures increased by $2 million to $83 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Our full-year capital spending is expected to be $154 million, which is $117 million lower than the target that was established at the beginning of the year and reflects changes in the timing of certain projects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised forecast includes $85 million related to the remodeling or relocation of approximately 60 existing stores and the opening of approximately 95 new stores, as well as $69 million for the development of information systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives. Cash used in investing activities is also lower this period as the current period included $8 million in minority investments as compared with $45 million spent in the corresponding prior-year period.

Financing Activities

[TABLE_END]

​

In the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $330 million of our credit facility which was repaid in full during the second quarter of 2020 . In July 2020, we entered into a new $600 million credit agreement and in connection with this transaction we paid fees of $4 million.

​

During the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock, as compared with 2,932,100 shares of our common stock repurchased in the corresponding prior-year period for $122 million . We also declared and paid dividends of $42 million and $84 million during the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 3, 2019, respectively. This represented quarterly rates of $0.40 for the first quarter of 2020 and $0.38 per share for both the first and second quarters of 2019. Our second quarter dividend was suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but has been reinstated for the third quarter at $0.15 per share.

Partially offsetting the amounts above were proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with employee stock programs of $2 million and $7 million for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2020 and August 1, 2019, respectively. Also, during the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2019 we paid $2 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of share-based equity awards.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Other than the adoption of ASU 2017-04 , Simplifying the test for Goodwill Impairment , on February 2, 2020 as discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 6, Goodwill , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Descriptions of the recently issued and adopted accounting principles are included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

During the quarter, the Company’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

We are currently migrating our e-commerce order management system. All North American e-commerce sites are live on the new system as of August 1, 2020. In connection with this implementation and resulting business process changes, we may make changes to the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. Also, during the first quarter of 2020 we substantially completed the rollout of our new point-of-sale software.

During the quarter ended August 1, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, other than the implementation of the new e-commerce order management system (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
