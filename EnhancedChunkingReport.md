# Performance Analysis: Enhanced Chunking Strategy

## Chunking Strategy Improvements

**Core Changes:**
- **Semantic Unit Splitting**: Split text by sentences (using `nltk.sent_tokenize`) instead of arbitrary fixed-size chunks to preserve meaning
- **Robust Fallback**: Long sentences automatically fall back to paragraph splitting to maintain manageable, coherent units
- **Sliding Window Overlap**: Configurable overlap between chunks prevents context loss at boundaries, ensuring queries spanning multiple chunks retrieve complete information

## Results Overview

The new semantic chunking strategy delivers **57% faster search performance** (1,266ms → 546ms average) while maintaining response quality for general queries. Numerical extraction remains inconsistent across different SEC filing formats.

## Latency Improvements

| Metric | Old Strategy | New Strategy | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Average Latency | 1,266ms | 546ms | -57% |
| Successful Tests | 6/7 improved | - | Substantial gains |
| Anomaly | Test 1 (Apple Revenue) | 1,426ms → 1,854ms | Needs investigation |

## Response Quality by Task Type

### General Information Retrieval
- **Apple Revenue, Tesla Risk Factors, Apple vs Microsoft AI**: Both strategies perform consistently
- **New strategy advantage**: Slightly more detailed responses due to semantic coherence

### Numerical Financial Calculations
- **Net Profit Margin**: Mixed results (Apple failed both, Microsoft regressed with new strategy)
- **P/E Ratio**: Success for Apple (both strategies)
- **Rule of 40**: Partial success for Tesla (revenue extracted, FCF failed)

## Key Bottlenecks

**Primary Issue**: Inconsistent numerical extraction from unstructured SEC filings
- Success varies by company and filing format
- `extract_value` function needs enhanced robustness
- Table-like structures poorly handled

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze raw filing formats** for failed extractions (Apple Net Income, Microsoft data, Tesla FCF)
2. **Enhance extract_value** with better regex patterns and table parsing
3. **Target specific filing sections** in semantic search queries
4. **Increase top_k** for financial data queries

## Observations

**Current Issue**: Agent struggles with numerical/tabular data extraction despite metadata enhancements. Narrative queries perform better than financial calculations.

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Search Optimization:**
- Increase `top_k` results for financial queries to provide more context
- Refine prompts for better financial data understanding

**Table Processing Enhancement:**
- Implement LLM-based table summarization to extract key metrics
- Embed table summaries alongside raw data (with linkage between both)
- Address potential over-correlation in `top_k` results

**Metadata Expansion:**
- Add key financial ratios and underlying numbers as metadata for consistent retrieval

**Goal**: Achieve reliable numerical data extraction from tabular SEC filings through improved metadata, advanced table processing, and optimized search strategies.

## Evaluation Framework Limitations

**Current Assessment**: Performance relies on manual test cases without systematic precision/recall metrics.

**Proposed Enhancement**: Develop comprehensive ground truth dataset with:
- **Query-Answer Pairs**: Curated questions with verified correct answers from SEC filings
- **Relevance Scoring**: Tagged chunks marked as relevant/irrelevant for each query
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Calculate precision, recall, F1 scores for retrieval accuracy
- **Comparative Analysis**: A/B test chunking strategies with statistical significance

This would enable objective performance measurement and systematic optimization guidance for future improvements.
