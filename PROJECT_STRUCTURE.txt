# Project Structure and File Explanations

This document provides an overview of the structure and files in the TakeHomeProject directory.

---

## Root Directory Files

- `.DS_Store`: System file created by macOS; can be ignored.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (e.g., API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone).
- `clients.py`: Initializes and configures clients for OpenAI (AsyncOpenAI) and Pinecone, loading API keys from the `.env` file. Used for interacting with embedding and vector database services.
- `embed_skeleton.py`: Contains asynchronous functions for processing SEC filings. It iterates through the `processed_filings` directory, processes each file, and contains placeholders for preprocessing, chunking, embedding, and uploading logic. Entry point for batch processing filings.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project, including OpenAI, Pinecone, dotenv, and others.
- `test_mcp.py`: Contains test code for running an OpenAI Agent with an MCP server, designed to answer financial questions based on SEC filings. Includes dummy prompts and placeholders for further testing.

## Directory: `processed_filings/`

Contains subdirectories for each company (by ticker symbol), each holding processed SEC filings in text format.

### Example Company Subdirectories

- `AAPL/`, `AMZN/`, `FL/`, `KO/`, `META/`, `MSFT/`, `NVDA/`, `TSLA/`

Each company directory contains multiple `.txt` files, named according to the company, form type (10K or 10Q), and filing date.

#### Example Files in `AAPL/`
- `AAPL_10K_2020-10-30.txt`: Apple's 10-K filing for 2020-10-30
- `AAPL_10Q_2024-05-03.txt`: Apple's 10-Q filing for 2024-05-03

#### Example Files in `AMZN/`
- `AMZN_10K_2025-02-07.txt`: Amazon's 10-K filing for 2025-02-07
- `AMZN_10Q_2024-11-01.txt`: Amazon's 10-Q filing for 2024-11-01

#### ...and similarly for other company directories.

Each `.txt` file contains the full text of a specific SEC filing for that company, form, and date.

## Summary
- The project is organized for processing and analyzing SEC filings by company and form type.
- Python scripts handle embedding, client configuration, and agent-based question-answering.
- All dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.
- Sensitive keys are managed via `.env` (not shared).

For further details, see the docstrings in each script or reach out to the project maintainer.
